    AB since DECADES , THE_FINANCIAL_INDUSTRY has experienced
       A_CONTINUOUS_EVOLUTION in SERVICE_DELIVERY due_to DIGITALIZATION .
       THIS_EVOLUTION is characterized by EXPANDED_CONNECTIVITY and ENHANCED_SPEED
       of INFORMATION_PROCESSING both at THE_CUSTOMER_INTERFACE and in
       BACK_OFFICE_PROCESSES . recently , there has been A_SHIFT in THE_FOCUS of
       DIGITALIZATION from improving THE_DELIVERY of TRADITIONAL_TASKS to
       introducing FUNDAMENTALLY_NEW_BUSINESS_OPPORTUNITIES and MODELS for
       FINANCIAL_SERVICE_COMPANIES . DIGITAL_FINANCE_ENCOMPASSES A_MAGNITUDE of
       NEW_FINANCIAL_PRODUCTS , FINANCIAL_BUSINESSES , FINANCE_RELATED_SOFTWARE ,
       and NOVEL_FORMS of customer COMMUNICATION_AND_INTERACTION delivered by
       FINTECH_COMPANIES and INNOVATIVE_FINANCIAL_SERVICE_PROVIDERS . against
       THIS_BACKDROP , THE_RESEARCH on FINANCE_AND_INFORMATION_SYSTEMS has started
       to analyze THESE_CHANGES and THE_IMPACT of DIGITAL_PROGRESS on
       THE_FINANCIAL_SECTOR . therefore , this article reviews the
       CURRENT_STATE_OF_RESEARCH in DIGITAL_FINANCE that DEALS with
       THESE_NOVEL_AND_INNOVATIVE_BUSINESS_FUNCTIONS . moreover , it gives
       AN_OUTLOOK on POTENTIAL_FUTURE_RESEARCH_DIRECTIONS . as A_CONCEPTUAL_BASIS
       for reviewing THIS_FIELD , THE_DIGITAL_FINANCE_CUBE , which embraces
       THREE_KEY_DIMENSIONS of DIGITAL_FINANCE and FINTECH , i.e.  , the
       RESPECTIVE_BUSINESS_FUNCTIONS , THE_TECHNOLOGIES and TECHNOLOGICAL_CONCEPTS
       applied as_well_as THE_INSTITUTIONS concerned , is introduced . this
       CONCEPTUALIZATION_SUPPORTS_RESEARCHERS and PRACTITIONERS when orientating in
       THE_FIELD of DIGITAL_FINANCE , allows for THE_ARRANGEMENT of
       ACADEMIC_RESEARCH relatively to each other , and enables for THE_REVELATION
       of THE_GAPS in RESEARCH . 2017 , springer verlag berlin heidelberg .
