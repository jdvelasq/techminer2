Ni X,A Machine Learning Based Regulatory Risk Index for Cryptocurrencies,2020,SSRN ELECTRONIC JOURNAL,,10.2139/SSRN.3699345,"Ni, Xinwen (School of Business and Economics)","Cryptocurrencies’ values often respond aggressively to major policy changes, but none of the existing indices informs on the market risks associated with regulatory changes. In this paper, we quantify the risks originating from new regulations on FinTech and cryptocurrencies (CCs), and analyse their impact on market dynamics. Specifically, a Cryptocurrency Regulatory Risk IndeX (CRRIX) is constructed based on policy-related news coverage frequency. The unlabelled news data are collected from the top online CC news platforms and further classified using a Latent Dirichlet Allocation model and Hellinger distance. Our results show that the machine-learning-based CRRIX successfully captures major policy-changing moments. The movements for both the VCRIX, a market volatility index, and the CRRIX are synchronous, meaning that the CRRIX could be helpful for all participants in the cryptocurrency market.

Fett D; Hosseyni P; Kuesters R,An Extensive Formal Security Analysis of the OpenID Financial-grade API,2019,ARXIV,,,"Fett, Daniel (); Hosseyni, Pedram (); Kuesters, Ralf ()","Forced by regulations and industry demand, banks worldwide are working to
open their customers' online banking accounts to third-party services via
web-based APIs. By using these so-called Open Banking APIs, third-party
companies, such as FinTechs, are able to read information about and initiate
payments from their users' bank accounts.
  One of the most promising standards in this segment is the OpenID
Financial-grade API (FAPI), currently under development in an open process by
the OpenID Foundation and backed by large industry partners. The FAPI is a
profile of OAuth 2.0 designed for high-risk scenarios and aiming to be secure
against very strong attackers. To achieve this level of security, the FAPI
employs a range of mechanisms that have been developed to harden OAuth 2.0.
  In this paper, we perform a rigorous, systematic formal analysis of the
security of the FAPI, based on the Web Infrastructure Model (WIM) proposed by
Fett, Kuesters, and Schmitz. To this end, we first develop a precise model of
the FAPI in the WIM, including different profiles and combinations of security
features. We then use our model of the FAPI to precisely define central
security properties. In an attempt to prove these properties, we uncover partly
severe attacks, breaking authentication, authorization, and session integrity
properties. We develop mitigations against these attacks and finally are able
to formally prove the security of a fixed version of the FAPI.
  This analysis is an important contribution to the development of the FAPI
since it helps to define exact security properties and attacker models, and to
avoid severe security risks.
  Of independent interest, we also uncover weaknesses in the aforementioned
security mechanisms for hardening OAuth 2.0. We illustrate that these
mechanisms do not necessarily achieve the security properties they have been
designed for",,,,,,,3,0.3333333333333333,,

Here we fill this gap by proposing an adapted Global Financial Network (GFN) framework for conceptualizing the organizational and geographic logic of the digital platform economy in finance, and applying it to examine the impact of the digital platform model on asset management. As we will show, asset management is being profoundly disrupted by what we dub digital asset management platforms—or DAMPs—which encompass services including index fund and ETF provision, robo-advising, and analytics and trading support. Like other digital platforms, DAMPs do not so much leverage technology to enhance their competitiveness within markets, as to radically restructure the market itself. Also, like other platforms, their rise has produced a winner-take-all paradox of centralization through democratization that defies predictions of technology-enabled industry decentralization. However, the logic and implications of the rise of DAMPs diverges, in other respects, from non-financial digital platforms, as finance has long possessed an informational intensity and regulatory and organizational fluidity characteristic of the digital platform economy. Consequently, the digital platform model has mostly developed endogenously in asset management through incremental innovation by major financial firms—in a process that has reinforced the position of leading incumbent asset management centers, and above all New York—rather than being introduced from the outside by upstart technology firms and clusters.

This paper empirically examines the effect of distrust in banks and financial institutions on the participation of lenders in P2P lending markets. We argue that in the choice of allocation of assets to banks, as an intermediary, or to alternative or disintermediated assets, such as P2P loans, distrust in the intermediary will shift allocation towards the latter. We exploit the role of geographical variation in distrust on lending on one of the largest P2P lending markets, Prospser.com. Our results show that beyond the effect of general trust on encouraging P2P participation, higher distrust in banks is associated with a higher likelihood of participation and higher levels of participation of lenders in loans. Furthermore, we find a negative correlation between the prevailing level of distrust in banks and volumes of commercial bank deposits, as well as banks’ ability to rely on deposit financing. The empirical evidence is consistent with our argument of asset substitution between banks and peer-to-peer lending due to lowered distrust in banks as intermediaries.

A portmanteau of “financial technology,” FinTech refers to the application of new technological advancements to products and services in the financial industry. The definition is rather broad and also encompasses “innovative ideas that improve financial service processes by proposing technological solutions according to different business situations, while the ideas could also lead to new business models or even new businesses.” Following the previous definitions, FinTech cannot be categorized as a brand new industry but rather as one that has evolved at an extremely rapid pace.

Burke J,FinTech,2021,,,10.1007/978-3-030-63967-9_10,"Burke, John J A (RISEBA University, Rīga, Latvia)","Financial innovation arguably started in Mesopotamia where the first books of account were inscribed in clay tablets. The bond market derives from war. Ferguson (2008) states, “The ability to finance war through a market for government debt was … an invention of the Italian Renaissance (Niall Ferguson, The Ascent of Money: A Financial History of the World 70 [Penguin Books 2008]). The joint stock company of the seventeenth century produced the first initial public offering, and established the first stock market, where shares of the United Dutch Chartered East India Company traded in a secondary market. The House of Rothschilds constructed an international finance system in the nineteenth century and used what now is called “big data” to enhance their fortune. Derivatives and securitised financial instruments, which developed in the twentieth century, magnificently illustrate financial innovation. Lewis Ranieri’s mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) left a notable impression in the twenty-first century. However, the term “FinTech” refers to disruptions to the financial services industry following the 2008 financial crisis, and the use of mobile technology. FinTech covers many innovative institutions and markets, for example, neo-banks, use of cryptocurrencies, improved payment systems, and crowdfunding/crowdlending peer-to-peer platforms. Although financial innovation started centuries ago, FinTech is the “next episode” of financial innovation",,,,,,,1,1.0,latvia,

Though banks can replicate most of what FinTech firms can do, FinTech firms benefit from an uneven playing field in that they are less regulated than banks. The uneven playing field enables nonbank FinTech firms to challenge banks in specific product areas where success is not tied to what makes banks unique—namely, their deposit‐gathering abilities and the potential for synergies with borrowers provided by deposits. And although banks’ responses to FinTech have also been hampered by their legacy IT systems and by internal frictions inherent in large diversified firms, FinTech's narrow product offerings and lack of established “franchises” appear to put clear limits on Fintech's ability to displace banks. Unlike Fintech, however, BigTech firms have some advantages that banks will find it harder to replicate, and so they present a much stronger challenge to established banks in two main areas: consumer finance and loans to small firms. And FinTech as well as BigTech are contributing to a trend in which banks are losing a comparative advantage that has derived from having more immediate access to information about parties seeking credit. The extent to which banks succeed in warding off such threats will depend on (1) their ability to make effective—and possibly even better—use of the same information technology now being used by its new competitors, and (2) their success in realizing economies of scale and scope that their nonbank competitors will find hard to match",,,,,,,1,1.0,,

What is the role of institutional factors on the international allocation of fintech venture capital? Research Findings/Insights: We document a notable change in the pattern of fintech venture capital (VC) investments around the world relative to other types of investments after the global financial crisis. We show that fintech venture capital investments are relatively more common in countries with weaker regulatory enforcement and without a major financial center after the financial crisis. Also, we show the fintech boom is more pronounced for smaller private limited partnership venture capitalists that likely have less experience with prior venture capital booms and busts. These fintech VC deals are substantially more likely to be liquidated, especially when located in countries without a major financial center. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We build on the institutions and corporate governance literatures by showing the importance of enforcement in driving relative differences in investment patterns and investor participation. For entrepreneurial startups, regulatory arbitrage drives investment into countries with a dearth of enforcement and regulatory costs. We argue that the spike in fintech venture capital in certain countries is attributable to differential enforcement of financial institution rules amongst startups versus large established financial institutions after the financial crisis. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Regulatory arbitrage in the context of fintech venture capital can spur booms and busts. Less experienced venture capitalists seem more prone to undertake investments that exacerbate boom and bust cycles. National governance is strengthened by the enforcement of regulatory standards, and corporate governance through investor experience and oversight can mitigate these swings, and facilitate better investment outcomes.

It is rarely mentioned in the media. Our research question is ‘Why does European microfinance suffer from a lack of visibility in the press?’ This study looked at news reports and press releases over a 18-month period (2016–2018) to check if European microfinance and its innovations were in the news. The study finds that, indeed, there are a lot of new innovations in finance. But, first, in Europe, the highly talked about fintech innovations are taking place outside of microfinance institutions (MFIs). Second, the innovations that are talked about in microfinance are taking place in developing countries out of Europe. The study followed this up by examining websites of some of the leading European fintech firms to see what they were doing that made them so visible. We share some best practices in the use of digital technologies by highly innovative fintech firms in areas that could be of use to MFIs in diverse sectors such as mobile payments, credit scoring, card readers, ATMs and management information systems. To become visible, European microfinance may need to demonstrate that it is doing new things and that it is using innovative technologies that helps it reduce costs, increase outreach and, thus, have an impact. Forii such as the European Microfinance Network and the European Microfinance Platform need to promote these innovations by offering appropriate awards.

Indeed, in Europe it is being promulgated with the help of networks such as the European Microfinance Network and the European Microfinance Platform. However, European Microfinance suffers from a visibility deficit. It is rarely mentioned in the media. Our research question is why European Microfinance suffers from a lack of visibility in the press? One could conjecture that the media likes to break news. Therefore, to become visible, European microfinance may need to demonstrate that it is doing new things and that it is using innovative technologies that help it reduce costs, increase outreach and thus have an impact. This study looked at news reports and press releases to check if European microfinance and its innovations were in the news.

Second, the innovations that are talked about in microfinance are taking place in developing countries out of Europe. More specifically, we find that in Europe, there are a lot of innovations taking place within the financial sphere by Fintech firms. Therefore, this study shares some best practices in the use of digital technologies by highly innovative fintech firms in areas that could be of use to MFIs. These firms have been especially present in providing mobile payments, credit scoring, card readers, ATMs and Management Information Systems. Out of Europe, the Findex report for 2017 indicates that Digital Technology is still very under-utilized in most part of the world, other than Sub-Saharan Africa. Nevertheless, our press review indicates that media is talking about the growth of digital technologies and ATMs in microfinance in developing countries. These are being promoted by awards/prizes for Fintech. These technologies are actively backed by large MFI networks such as FINCA. The sector is witnessing alliances as well as takeovers between the financial service provider and the telecom operator. The work is important because of its recent nature and because it summarizes the best practices that are being used by highly innovative firms. It will be useful to European MFIs who are looking for ideas on how to use technology for microfinance, improve their visibility to attract funding and to improve their impact through cost reduction and outreach increase",,,,,,,1,1.0,,

Experimental evidence is provided in support of this argument. Further, it is argued that regulation disparities across communication mediums may result in more wrongful accusations of advisor misconduct, less reporting of genuine misconduct, less self-policing among industry members, and greater unrectifiable consumer harm.

Based on recent research reports, surveys, papers, and statistics collected from secondary and tertiary published literature, this chapter tries to analyse and extract the basic points and facts related to the FinTech industry in general, and most particularly in developing countries. Hence, the main objective of this chapter may allow some answers to the core expected factors that may influence FinTech adoption in some selected developing countries. The key findings, across investigations covering three main regions, Latin America, Africa, and Asia, concluded there is high potential capacity to invest in this sector because of the development of mobile money in those countries most studied.

FinTech start-ups tend to be formed by, on average, three founders who complement their expertise in both the IT and financial industry fields. An average start-up capital of around USD 500,000 to USD 1 million seems to be the norm for local FinTech start-ups. Multiple funding sources are typically considered, including family funds, in many cases required by outside investors as proof of commitment. Government policies (e.g., free rental and tax cuts in early stages) were deemed important for initial growth. The study's regional focus might not validate a generalisation to other financial centres but findings contribute further understanding of the FinTech phenomenon in one of the world's most active finance markets.

Its ‘know thy (irrational) customer’ vision combines behavioural economics with predictive algorithms to accelerate access to, and monitor engagement with, finance. The digital revolution adds new layers to the material cultures of financial(ised) inclusion, offering the state new ways of expanding the inclusion of the ‘legible’, and global finance new forms of ‘profiling’ poor households into generators of financial assets.

To accomplish this aim, a conceptual framework based on knowledge-based theory and literature review was developed. The data for this research was collected through a self-administered questionnaire with 181 respondents. The target respondents were managers of commercial banks in Lebanon. The empirical findings of the study suggest that the practice of knowledge management functions practice has a positive and significant relationship with Fintech innovation. The findings also provide support for the moderating effect of only two demographic characteristics of bank managers: experience and position on the relationship between knowledge management and Fintech innovation in commercial banks in Lebanon. The study findings may aid future researchers in their quest to understand the inherent relationships that lie between the constructs’ questions and provide a platform for banking managers in their efforts to improve their innovation strategies through knowledge management.
