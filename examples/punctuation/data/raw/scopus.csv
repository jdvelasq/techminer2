In order to reduce the economic loss caused by the wrong bidding decision，a multi-time scale market bidding model of WCS is established. Based on the existing market mechanism of the United States，the benefit and cost models of WCS participating in the energy market and frequency regulation auxiliary service market are established. In order to improve the accuracy of WCS’s bidding strategy，a quantitative model is carried out for the uncertainty of wind power output based on the Copula function，based on which part of the energy storage output capacity is reserved，so as to reduce the economic risk caused by the deviation power. With the goal of maximizing the expected net income of WCS，the day-ahead bidding strategies for energy market and frequency regulation auxiliary service market are formulated，and the bidding decisions are revised on the basis of ultra-short-term wind power forecast data in the intra-day stage. A multi-time scale market participation strategy of WCS is proposed considering the uncertainty of wind power output. Taking a practical WCS in China as an example，the results show that the proposed strategy can effectively improve the economic benefits of WCS and avoid the waste of resources. © 2024 Electric Power Automation Equipment Press.

The contribution of minor and major failure to the operational expenditures (OPEX) of wind turbines is estimated. It is demonstrated that the minor failure, mainly, surface erosion, is the largest contributor to the unplanned repair, 12 times higher than structural failure. The shortening of material curing procedure can lead to the significant reduction of repair costs, and LCOE, and expand the so-called “repair window.” The analysis of the role of defects and voids in adhesives on the post-repair lifetime of wind turbine blades and energy costs is carried out. Using the continuum damage mechanics approach, it is demonstrated that the voids in adhesives drastically reduce the post-repair lifetime of wind turbine blades. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","adhesion; damage; modeling; repair; wind turbine blades","Adhesives; Continuum damage mechanics; Cost benefit analysis; Failure (mechanical); Fracture mechanics; Repair; Turbine components; Wind turbines; Continuum damage; Levelized costs; Major failures; Operational expenditures; Repair technology; Structural failure; Surface erosion; Wind turbine blades; continuum damage mechanics; cost analysis; energy planning; failure analysis; operations technology; repair; wind turbine; Turbomachine blades","","","","","Innovation Foundation of Denmark, (8055‐00012A)","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the Innovation Foundation of Denmark in the framework of the Grand Solutions project DURALEDGE, (""Durable leading edges for high tip speed wind turbine blades""), File nr.: 8055‐00012A.

Against this background, this study introduces several weather derivatives based on wind speed and temperature as underlying assets and examines their effectiveness. In particular, we propose new standardized derivatives with higher-order monomial payoff functions, such as “wind speed cubic derivatives” and “wind speed and temperature cross derivatives.” In contrast to the existing nonparametric derivatives, the minimum variance hedging problem to find the optimal contract amount of these standardized derivatives is reduced to estimating a linear regression. We also develop a market trading model to put the proposed standardized derivatives into practical use and clarify the real-world implications of standardizing weather derivatives. Furthermore, to make trading more efficient, we propose a “product selection” strategy utilizing the “variable selection” approach of LASSO regression. Empirical analysis confirms hedging effectiveness comparable to existing nonparametric derivatives and reveals the effectiveness of the proposed derivatives standardization scheme as well as their trading strategies. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.","Empirical simulations; Generalized additive model; LASSO regression; Optimal hedging; Weather derivatives; Wind power","Commerce; Investments; Power generation; Regression analysis; Risk management; Standardization; Wind speed; Empirical simulations; Generalized additive model; LASSO regression; Nonparametrics; Optimal hedging; Trading strategies; Weather derivatives; Wind power generation; Wind speed; Wind temperature; Wind power","","","","",", (19K22024)","This work was funded by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (A) 20H00285, Grant-in-Aid for Challenging Research (Exploratory) 19K22024, and Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists 21K14374 from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS).","Aksoy B., Selbas R., Estimation of wind turbine energy production value by using machine learning algorithms and development of implementation program, Energ Sour Part a Recovery Utilization Environ Effects, 43, 6, pp. 692-704, (2021); Benth F.E., Pircalabu A., A non-Gaussian Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model for pricing wind power futures, Appl Math Finan, 25, 1, pp. 36-65, (2018); Benth F.E., Di Persio L., Lavagnini S., Stochastic modeling of wind derivatives in energy markets, Risks, 6, 2, pp. 1-21, (2018); Bilal B., Ndongo M., Adjallah K.H., Sava A., Kebe C.M., Ndiaye P.A., Sambou V., Wind Turbine Power Output Prediction Model Design Based on Artificial Neural Networks and Climatic Spatiotemporal Data, (2018); de Giorgi M.G., Ficarella A., Tarantino M., Assessment of the benefits of numerical weather predictions in wind power forecasting based on statistical methods, Energy, 36, 7, pp. 3968-3978, (2011); Foley A.M., Leahy P.G., Marvuglia A., McKeogh E.J., Current methods and advances in forecasting of wind power generation, Renew Energ, 37, 1, pp. 1-8, (2012); Gersema G., Wozabal D., An Equilibrium Pricing Model for Wind Power Futures, 65, pp. 64-74, (2017); Hanifi S., Liu X., Lin Z., Lotfian S., A critical review of wind power forecasting methods—past, present and future, Energies, 13, 15, (2020); Hastie T., Tibshirani R., Generalized Additive Models, (1990); IEA (2021) Renewables.

In May 2004, CEC announced a new WGE partnership with Marubeni Corp., a giant Japanese industrial conglomerate. One of the justifications for wind-generated electricity (WGE) was that the world faced considerable uncertainty in terms of its future supplies of fossil fuels, notably oil, and that this uncertainty would directly impact utilities’ ability to meet future demands for electricity. Critics of WGE’s economics note that wherever it is used, it is accompanied by massive state subsidies. Referring to Denmark’s WGE experience, one American-based critic claimed that the Danish Energy Commission subsidizes nearly 30% of the true cost of producing wind power in that country. The company was seeking regulatory approval for the development of a 27-turbine wind farm to produce WGE atop Glebe Mountain, in south-central Vermont. © 2006 by Georgetown University, Pew Case Study Center, USA.","","","","","","","","","Ferguson N., War of the winds, National Post, (2004); Herrick T., The new Texas wind rush, The Wall Street Journal, (2002); The Vermont Sierran, 24, 2, pp. 6-7, (2000); Phillips W.G., Are we really running out of oil?, Popular Science, (2000); Lomborg B., The skeptical environmentalist: Measuring the real state of the world, (2001); Boucher T., Stoddard T., Do you prefer wind or coal?, The Burlington Free Press, (2003); Seelye K.Q., (2003); On site power systems deliver cost savings and emission reductions, (2003); Kirsner S., (2003); Mazur F., Wind power not practical, The Burlington Free Press, (2003); McGrath K., Facts and fictions on wind power, The Burlington Free Press, (2003); Tempest R., Bird lovers blast wind farms, The Detroit News, (2003); Burkett E., A mighty wind, The New York Times Magazine, pp. 48-51, (2003); Ziner K.L., Offshore harvest of wind s proposed for Cape Cod, The New York Times, (2002); Belluck P., (2003); (2004); Who we are, (2004); Why Glebe Mountain?, (2004); Wind turbines are not magic, (2004); The Vermont visitor 2001, (2002); Kelley K., Conference facilities expand at tourist venues, Vermont Business Magazine, pp. 33-34, (2002); Vermont tourism data 2001, (2002); Marcel J., After 9/11: Domestic tourism thrived, international waned, Vermont Business Magazine, pp. 31-32, (2002); What is our vision?, (2004); The Burlington Free Press, (2004); Wind turbines are not magic, (2004); An open letter to the community, (2003); Wind turbines are not magic, (2004); Allen A.W., Wind turbine project stirs Londonderry: Glebe Mountain debate focuses on environment, (2004); Welcome to the Glebe Mountain Group web site, (2004); Crawford M., Outdoors folks wary of wind development, The Burlington Free Press, (2004); Smallheer S., Group pulls out of wind planning, Rutland Herald, (2004)","","","Taylor and Francis","","","","","","","978-135128027-3; 978-190609301-3","","","English","Sustainability Management and Strategy: The oikos collection","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135673211"

To achieve this，a game-theoretic optimization bidding model is proposed for leasing energy storage of wind farm clusters，considering fre⁃ quency regulation performance indicator assessment. The model consists of two layers：the upper layer models the bidding process in the frequency regulation market with multiple participants，while the lower layer models a leader-follower game between energy storage lessors and wind farm clusters regarding leasing price and capacity. In this game，the energy storage operator acts as the leader，setting the leasing price in response to the leasing plan of wind farm clusters，and the wind farm clusters，as the follower，adjust the leasing plan according to the price. Addition⁃ ally，an evolutionary threshold public goods game model is embedded within the wind farm clusters to address the cooperation dilemma caused by selfish behavior among individual members. By united solution of the model，the bidding strategy for leasing energy storage capacity and participating in the frequency regulation market is obtained. The case study results demonstrate that the proposed strategy effectively resolves the cooperation dilemma and en⁃ hances the overall profitability of the wind farm clusters. © 2024 Editorial Department of Zhejiang Electric Power.

First, considering the correlation between wind speeds in offshore wind farms, the PSO is used to optimize the weight coefficient of the mixed Copula function, and a wind speed correlation model based on the mixed Copula function is established. Secondly, for the fixed cost allocation problem of the offshore wind farm integration system, the fixed cost allocation method based on the Shapley value solution of cooperative game is used to establish the cooperative game model of the fixed cost allocation of the offshore wind farm integration system.

This study investigates the possibility of evaluating the economic spillover effects and CO2 emissions to evaluate new energy policy objectives by investing in solar and wind power generation systems. The research results show that the short-term solar investment in economic effects is superior to wind power generation, and the economic spillover increases the scale of CO2 emissions. The main reason is that the high ratio of equipment for wind power generation comes from imports and reduces the spillover effect. Observing the economic spillover effects of individual industries, solar investment has the largest increase in “Sewage Treatment Sector and Resource Recovery” sectors, while wind investment has the largest increase in “Machinery-related industries.” The scale of CO2 emissions in individual industries, solar investment has increased the most emissions by “Chemical” sectors, and wind investment has increased by “Service industries.” However, from a long-term perspective, the industrial upgrading through economic restructuring and the low emission coefficient of wind power will greatly improve the economic spillover effect of wind investment and improve the environment. © 2019, Econjournals.

The offshore wind power operation and maintenance process considering meteorological accessibility is first analyzed based on the impact of meteorological conditions. Then，we propose the method of calculating economic evaluation indexes including downtime，power loss，wind farms availability，operation and maintenance cost. The benefit simulation model of offshore wind power operation and maintenance is established based on Anylogic platform. The real- time status of wind turbines，ships and personnel and the statistics of various economic evaluation indexes are simulated to evaluate the economic benefits of operation and maintenance of offshore wind power farms. Finally，the case results show that the proposed model can simulate the operation and maintenance process of offshore wind power farms and accurately calculate the key indicators such as downtime，power loss，wind farm availability，operation and maintenance cost. The impact of offshore meteorological conditions on the economic effect is truthfully reflected，which provides technical reference for the operation and maintenance of offshore wind power farms. © 2023 Science Press.
