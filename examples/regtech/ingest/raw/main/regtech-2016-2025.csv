While prior research has predominantly emphasized algorithmic performance, detection accuracy, or regulatory compliance in isolation, a critical gap remains in understanding the human-centered dynamics that shape real-world operational outcomes. Addressing this gap, the review examines how financial institutions navigate compliance demands and operational constraints, drawing on the Australian regulatory environment as an illustrative governance reference, including expectations articulated by AUSTRAC. Building on this synthesis, the study identifies structural gaps in Trust Calibration and oversight practices. It introduces a Dynamic Trust Modulation (DTM) framework to conceptualize how trust evolves across AML workflows. The framework models trust as a fluid, context-dependent construct shaped by system behavior, analyst workload, explainability mechanisms, and regulatory pressure. By framing trust, explainability, and decision fatigue as interdependent components of human–AI collaboration, this review advances a more holistic perspective on socio-technical system design in financial crime detection. The proposed framework contributes theoretically by extending human–AI trust research into the AML domain and practically by offering actionable design principles to enhance system accountability, decision defensibility, and adaptive compliance in operational AML environments. © (2025), (Science and Information Organization).

This paper explores the rise of Regulatory Technology (RegTech) and Supervisory Technology (SupTech) as instruments of digital regulatory governance and examines their implications for administrative efficiency, defined as the optimization of regulatory and supervisory processes through automation and data-driven coordination, institutional capacity, and policy innovation. Using a systematic literature review of 59 peer-reviewed studies published between 2017 and 2025, the study identifies how RegTech enhances compliance management and risk control in financial institutions, while SupTech enables regulators to improve supervisory agility, transparency, and real-time oversight. The findings show that these technologies create significant administrative value by streamlining reporting, enhancing accountability, and strengthening governance networks across the public–private interface. However, adoption is constrained by cybersecurity vulnerabilities, algorithmic opacity, regulatory fragmentation, and organizational resistance. To address these issues, the study proposes an integrated governance framework that maps opportunities and barriers across compliance, risk, technology, and institutional coordination. By synthesizing fragmented evidence, this research contributes to the field of administrative sciences by positioning RegTech and SupTech not only as technical innovations but as transformative tools of digital public administration and regulatory modernization. © 2025 by the authors.","administrative innovation; digital transformation; financial regulation; institutional capacity; RegTech; regulatory governance; supervisory technology; SupTech","","","","","","","","Abubakar, Yahaya Idris, A Systematic Review of Rare Events Detection Across Modalities Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning, IEEE Access, 12, pp. 47091-47109, (2024); Asian Journal of Research in Computer Science, (2025); International Journal of Science and Research Archive, (2025); Studies in Learning and Teaching, (2023); Empowering Financial Supervision A Suptech Experiment Using Machine Learning in an Early Warning System, (2025); Anagnostopoulos, Yiannis, Fintech and regtech: Impact on regulators and banks, Journal of Economics and Business, 100, pp. 7-25, (2018); Antunes, José Américo Pereira, To supervise or to self-supervise: a machine learning based comparison on credit supervision, Financial Innovation, 7, 1, (2021); Armstrong, Brenna, Financial Crises and the Selection and Survival of Women Finance Ministers, American Political Science Review, 118, 3, pp. 1305-1323, (2024); Developments in Regtech and Suptech, (2018); Arner, Douglas W., FinTech, regTech, and the reconceptualization of financial regulation, Northwestern Journal of International Law and Business, 37, 3, pp. 373-415, (2017)","S.

This study aims to develop a comprehensive RegTech adoption model grounded in the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework and systems theory to investigate the enablers and barriers to RegTech adoption. Methodology/Design/Approach: Data were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) with SmartPLS 4.0. The survey included 500 randomly selected banking professionals. The study examined RegTech adoption enablers and barriers, its mediating role on AML system effectiveness, and the moderating impact of adoption motivation. Results: The findings reveal that technological and organizational enablers positively influence both RegTech adoption and AMLSE. Organizational barriers indirectly affect AMLSE, while technological barriers hinder RegTech adoption. Mediation analysis underscores the significant role of technological and organizational enablers in enhancing AMLSE through RegTech adoption. The moderated analysis provides insights into the complex interactions between motivations for RegTech adoption and various enablers. Practical Implications: This research offers actionable insights for stakeholders and establishes a strong foundation for future studies on RegTech adoption and AML compliance in similar socio-economic contexts. It highlights the importance of TOE factors in successfully implementing RegTech solutions to enhance AML system effectiveness. offering a nuanced understanding of their interaction in shaping compliance outcomes. Originality/Value: By establishing a conceptual framework based on TOE theory and systems theory, this study addresses a significant research gap in RegTech adoption within the banking sector. The research contributes both theoretically and practically by developing an empirical, multi-dimensional RegTech adoption model that incorporates key enablers, barriers, mediators, and moderators, providing a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing RegTech adoption. © 2025","AML; AML system effectiveness; Compliance; RegTech; Regtech adoption; Regulatory technology; Systems theory; TOE framework","","","","","","","","Determinants for the Adoption of Regulatory Technology Regtech Services by the Companies in United Arab Emirates an Mcdm Approach, (2020); Arner, Douglas W., FinTech, regTech, and the reconceptualization of financial regulation, Northwestern Journal of International Law and Business, 37, 3, pp. 373-415, (2017); Bresnahan, Timothy F., Adoption of new information and communications technologies in the workplace today, Innovation Policy and the Economy, 17, 1, pp. 95-124, (2017); Hassani, Hossein, Banking with blockchain-ed big data, Journal of Management Analytics, 5, 4, pp. 256-275, (2018); Procedia Comput Sci, (2015); Bouwman, Harry, The impact of digitalization on business models, Digital Policy, Regulation and Governance, 20, 2, pp. 105-124, (2018); Fight Against Money Laundering the Impact of Current Regulations on Organized Crime, (2022); undefined, (2023); undefined, (2023); J Leg Ethical Regul Issues, (2022)","M.

Based on our experience in building company ownership graphs at the Bank of Italy, this paper presents a distributed reasoning solution to the qualifying holding problem. Qualifying holdings measure an entity's influence over a bank or financial intermediary and serve as a key metric in banking supervision. Their calculation is particularly challenging due to the large scale of real-world ownership networks and their structural complexity - -the latter often not fully addressed by existing regulatory frameworks. To our knowledge, no standardised, efficient computational approach that also faithfully reflects regulatory interpretations has ever been proposed, leaving a significant gap between legal requirements and practical capabilities. We fill this gap by proposing the first mathematical formalisation of the qualifying holding problem, proving it to be inherently hard (#P-complete). Despite its general intractability, we develop a logic-based reasoning algorithm based on Datalog± that enables efficient and parallel computation of qualifying holdings across real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments confirm its practical effectiveness and scalability. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","company ownership graph; datalog; qualifying holdings; regulatory technology","Complex networks; Computation theory; Computational efficiency; Computer circuits; Distributed computer systems; Information management; Information systems; Based reasonings; Company ownership graph; Complex problems; Corporates; Datalog; Distributed reasonings; In-buildings; Qualifying holding; Regulatory technology; Scalable methods; Scalability","","","","","","","Foundations of Databases, (1995); Alfonsi, Tommaso, Expressing Biological Problems with Logical Reasoning Languages, CEUR Workshop Proceedings, 3229, (2022); 4th International Workshop on the Resurgence of Datalog in Academia and Industry, (2022); Aref, Molham, Design and implementation of the LogicBlox system, Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, 2015-May, pp. 1371-1382, (2015); Atzeni, Paolo, Weaving enterprise knowledge graphs: The case of company ownership graphs∗, Advances in Database Technology - EDBT, 2020-March, pp. 555-566, (2020); Regtech, (2017); 4th Jafee International Conference on Investment and Derivatives, (1998); Barabási, Albert Lásló, Emergence of scaling in random networks, Science, 286, 5439, pp. 509-512, (1999); Bellomarini, Luigi, Reasoning on company takeovers: From tactic to strategy, Data and Knowledge Engineering, 141, (2022); Bellomarini, Luigi, The Vadalog Parallel System: Distributed Reasoning with Datalog+/-, Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 17, 13, pp. 4614-4626, (2024)","","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","ACM SIGIR; ACM SIGWEB","34th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, CIKM 2025","2025-11-10 through 2025-11-14","Seoul","214495","","9798400720406","","","English","CIKM - Proc.

Currently, organizations face challenges in regulatory compliance due to the complexity of regulations, frequent updates, and difficulty in identifying changes that impact policies and procedures. Existing literature provides guidance to a certain extent on how to anticipate regulatory modifications or ensure timely compliance. This review examines current literature on applying machine learning (ML) and Generative AI (GenAI) to extract, structure, and interpret regulatory content. It surveys techniques for converting regulations into machine-readable formats, predicting regulatory changes, and assessing alignment with real-world modifications issued by regulatory bodies. The findings indicate that using MRC, MRR, and AI enables automated compliance checks, faster detection of violations or errors, standardized compliance processes, real-time monitoring, and automatic report generation. These approaches can significantly enhance regulatory adherence across industries, particularly in sectors such as finance, where compliance is critical. © (2025), (Science and Information Organization).

In recent years, regulatory technology (RegTech) has served as a prime focus in the banking sector and may further spillover to external parties. This paper aims to investigate whether bank RegTech enhances corporate investment efficiency (CIE) through its influence on lending activities. Using novel matched bank–firm loan data from 2013 to 2023, we empirically demonstrate that bank RegTech improves CIE. A 1% rise in the standard deviation of bank RegTech corresponds to a maximum of approximately 18.13% improvement in average CIE. Specifically, bank RegTech enhances CIE by mitigating financing constraints, strengthening governance capabilities, and reducing operational risks. The beneficial effects of bank RegTech on CIE are further amplified by information transparency and media coverage, while industry competition weakens this effect. The impact of bank RegTech on CIE exhibits heterogeneous characteristics, varying with different dimensions of bank RegTech and firm-level characteristics. Our results still hold after alleviating endogeneity concerns and performing robustness checks. Furthermore, we find that improvements in CIE enhance firm performance, stimulate innovation, and promote job creation. © 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","financing constraints; governance capacity; investment efficiency; operational risk; regulatory technology","","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSF, (72103082); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSF; Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE, (23YJA910004); Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE; Jiangsu Normal University, JSNU, (2024XKT1402); Jiangsu Normal University, JSNU; Graduate Research and Innovation Projects of Jiangsu Province, (KYCX25_3188); Graduate Research and Innovation Projects of Jiangsu Province","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 72103082), Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education of China (Grant No. 23YJA910004), the Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Normal University (Grant No. 2024XKT1402), and the Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province (Grant No. KYCX25_3188).

Design/methodology/approach To achieve this research goal, a vector autoregression methodology was conducted on three endogenous performance indicators of panel data from 23 different technological infrastructure countries during the period 2012–2021. By enabling the examination of how exogenous variables of monetary policy tools, prudential regulations influence one another while accounting for heterogeneity across countries. Findings The monetary tools such as required reserve, interest rate and money growth had a modest effect on banking performance. In contrast, prudential regulatory measures such as capital adequacy ratio, liquidity coverage ratio and leverage significantly impact stability and profitability. Besides, the RegTech sandbox dummy variable validated a positive but varying effect on the three performance indicators ΔROA (0.011 p < 0.05), ROE (0.120 p > 0.050 and NIM (0.052 p < 0.050) implying that the current scale and integration of RegTech solutions may not yet be sufficient to produce substantial profitability gains and introduce the need for regulatory updates for better future banks’ performance.

The surveillance brought by technology can easily stimulate Generation Z employees to develop a rebellious mentality, which in turn can have negative effects. The core issue of this article is whether the use of intelligent digital supervision technology can achieve the expected management effects for the Z generation, a special group of employees. This article uses the evolutionary game analysis method to establish a two-sided evolutionary game model. The conclusion is that when the punishment risk that Generation Z employees may face by choosing not to increase their work enthusiasm is greater than the time and energy sacrificed by choosing to increase their work enthusiasm, Generation Z employees will consider punishment and choose to give up their rest time to increase their work enthusiasm. At this time, the use of intelligent digital supervision technology by enterprises can improve the work enthusiasm of Generation Z employees; On the contrary, Generation Z employees will choose not to increase their work enthusiasm.

The rate at which the technology is innovating is astounding. The ability of AI and Gen AI systems to simulate human intelligence (human thinking) and independently perform tasks and develop intelligence that is premised on its own experiences, process layers of information and continually learn and re-learn increasingly complex representations of data has resulted in improvements in “it” being able to perform complex, technical and time-consuming tasks; identify objects, people, voices and patterns; and screen for “problems” much earlier and provide solutions. This has economic, political and social benefits. The purpose of this study is to explore how Gen AI is changing the face of finance and its impact on the risks, regulatory and operational challenges faced by financial institutions in the UK. Design/methodology/approach: The subject is explored through the analysis of data and domestic and international published literature. The first part of this study summarises the context of current risks and regulatory and operational issues; the discussion then moves on to explore Gen AI and how it can be embedded as part of the arsenal that financial institutions can use/are using to innovate and provide solutions to the regulatory and operational challenges they face as of August 2024. Findings: It is suggested that UK financial institutions can further use Gen AI as part of their armoury of solutions to respond to the risk of financial crime and tackle the regulatory burden to achieve high levels of operational efficiency as well as promoting better customer satisfaction. Originality: The work is original because, to the best of the author’s knowledge, it is the first to specifically explore how Gen AI is assisting UK financial institutions to find solutions to financial crime risk and regulatory challenges, customer satisfaction, cyberattacks and cybercrime. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cybercrime; English law; Financial crime; FinTech; Generative AI; Generative artificial intelligence; LawTech; RegTech","","","","","","","","Mitigating Human Bias in AI, (2020); Intelligent Financial System how AI is Transforming Finance, (2024); Introducing Claude, (2023); Exploring the Relationship Between AI and Natural Language Processing, (2023); Bellamy, Rachel K.E., AI Fairness 360: An extensible toolkit for detecting and mitigating algorithmic bias, IBM Journal of Research and Development, 63, 4-5, (2019); Post Human Futures Human Enhancement Artificial Intelligence and Social Theory the Future of the Human, (2023); Fintech Magazine, (2022); A Cybersecure Digital Transformation in A Complex Threat Environment, (2021); Consumer Survey 2022 Fraud Identity and Digital Banking in the Uk, (2022); Facts in Relation to the Prudential Regulatory Authority and Financial Planning Committee, (2025)","C.

Need for the Study: In response to the escalating complexity and volatility of regulatory requirements after the 2008 global financial crisis (GFC), RegTech has emerged worldwide. It harnesses the power of cutting-edge technologies to automate compliance, monitor regulatory changes, and provide real-time risk assessments. The development of RegTech solutions in developing countries is still in its nascent stages, and Bangladesh seems to be no exception. Methodology: This study employs a secondary data-based research design, collecting data from the annual reports of the Bangladesh Financial Intelligence Unit (BFIU) and various commercial banks from 2017 to 2021. The data analysis employs descriptive statistics and content analysis to measure FinTech growth and assess the effectiveness of RegTech policies adopted by banks. Findings: The study found a 657% increase in registered users from 2014 to 2022, with transactions rising from BDT104.83 billion to BDT961.33 billion. Bangladesh has enacted strong policies against illicit financial activities, indicating that it is in the early RegTech 2.0 stage focusing on regulatory compliance. Practical Implications: The analysis reveals that Bangladesh's lag in RegTech adoption, which exacerbates money laundering and suspicious transactions due to the increased use of FinTech. Regulatory authorities should enhance technology, enforce policies, and raise awareness to detect financial non-compliance. © 2025 by S. M. Sohrab Uddin, Mohammad Osman Goni and Tasnim Ara Hossen.

We initially constructed a bank-level RegTech index by mining banks' annual reports. We reveal that internal RegTech can significantly mitigate bank credit risk. Concretely, a one-standard-deviation increase in internal RegTech level leads to a 7.39–11.90 % decrease in bank credit risk. Regulatory intensity, income diversification, and charter value are identified as potential channels. The cross-sectional analysis demonstrates that the credit risk mitigation effect of internal RegTech is more pronounced in non-listed and low administrative-expense banks. Our main conclusions remain robust after addressing potential endogeneity issues, ruling out the potential effect of bank financial technology, alternative proxies for the dependent variable, alternative sample periods, and clustering of standard errors.

The basic idea is that the freedom of movement of the individual has been comple mented by the freedom of movement of data and information. One of the new European spaces is the space for the movement of health data. Here we are dealing both with the transfer of sensitive personal data and, above all, with quality assurance. The transfer of an individual‘s health data from one cultural and scientifi c environment to another is an exceptionally demanding operation. It is not only a question of ensuring the technological path of information as such. And the more general transfer of care data is also a very de manding transfer of data. That is why the EU wants strict rules on the use of anonymised or pseudonymised health data for research, innovation and decision-making too. Regulation of the information space for health data is a broad issue. It is the fi rst thematic regulation of the data and information space in accordance with the EU data strategy. We are witnessing an extremely important stage of social development in terms of human dignity, one involv ing many tensions. For example, there has been and still is an undeniable confl ict of values and objectives between our right to self-determination and the various re-uses of medical data. Equally, data security needs to be highlighted in a new way in this context. In this brief presentation I will focus on the vital aspects of the transferability of data and information on the quality of care. This is, as I understand it, the necessary starting point for a new, compre hensive set of regulations. The internationalisation of healthcare has made good progress on the linguistic level, but there is still work to be done to harmonise essential treatment information. AI could give this a new impetus. The second key part of the regulation, the secondary use of health data, is outside the scope of this paper as well as the question of the authorities. © 2025, Editions Weblaw.

It examines how auditors’ capabilities and characteristics influence their effectiveness in anti-money laundering (AML). Quantitative data were collected through a survey of 228 external auditors in Sudan. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to analyze the data. Auditors’ skills in rigorous financial analysis and investigation significantly improve their AML performance. Additionally, a strong ethical orientation positively affects auditors’ effectiveness. However, practical experience did not enhance the detection of money laundering. Most notably, the adoption of advanced technologies and analytics tools had the strongest positive impact. The findings highlight the need for enhanced auditor training, greater investments in regulatory technology (RegTech), increased oversight of ethics, and expanded information-sharing between auditors, regulators, and financial institutions. This study provides unique empirical evidence on leveraging external auditors’ capabilities to combat money laundering, specifically within the Sudanese context.

These strategies set stricter governance standards for key industries and propose new requirements for supervising industrial sources. The authors reviewed the current status of industrial air pollutant emissions in China and their impacts on ambient air quality. Additionally, they comprehensively evaluated the emission detection methods for current stationary source emissions and the corresponding supervision methods. The results indicated that the pollution situation had improved under the control of industrial sources. In the future, it was expected that the accuracy and timeliness of industrial source emissions monitoring would be further enhanced through the integration of multi-source data, thereby achieving more accurate and real-time supervision of industrial source emissions. With the development of information technology, the application of the Internet of Things and big data in industrial sources supervision is becoming increasingly widespread, which could compensate for the shortcomings in the precision and spatiotemporal resolution of current industrial sources supervision. Industrial electricity consumption data, which has broad coverage, strong real-time capabilities, and high data quality, could be used to design and develop electricity monitoring indicators. These indicators could serve as an auxiliary means for supervising industrial source emissions. © 2025 Editorial Board Journal of Environmental Engineering Technology.

We observe fintech companies disrupting banks by offering no-fee banking services along with features that assist consumers to avoid overdraft fees and interest-free cash advances. This raises the question would fintech companies eat banks for breakfast? Fintech products have democratized financial services by empowering consumers to change financial habits, gain fuller understanding of their finances, and evaluate choices with confidence to make informed financial decisions.

Despite the ongoing initiatives to establish AI governance principles, research on regulating legal AI and broader AI applications remains limited. This study addresses this gap through a qualitative case study examining effective AI governance frameworks. Interviews with four senior legal experts, i.e., two judges, a law professor, and a legal researcher, identified emerging challenges of legal AI and beyond. The findings reveal pressing needs for adaptive, transparent, and equitable regulation to ensure responsible AI development and use.

With this emerging trend, Regulatory Technology (RegTech) has become a key driver in streamlining regulatory processes, reducing operational costs, and enhancing efficiency. This trend is a result of exciting technological innovations such as artificial intelligence (AI), big data, blockchain, and automation that are advancing at a war pace speed, and have redefined how businesses, institutions and governments maintain compliance, mitigate risks, and uphold transparency. Despite advancement, using technology in regulatory practices faces major challenges like data privacy, cybersecurity threats, and ethical issues with AI decision-making. These issues raise crucial questions about implementing RegTech. Further, with the fast-paced advancement of technology, the regulatory framework often struggles to keep pace, leading to a gap between policy development and emerging risks. This chapter explores the impact of evolving innovations, and rising complexities on regulatory technology (RegTech) and discuss its future. The chapter primarily focuses on regulatory frameworks drafted to balance innovation with security and ethical concerns. By analyzing advancing technology in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data, the chapter provides insight into the implications of these technologies for RegTech with a focus on businesses, policymakers and society. As digital transformation continues to accelerate, regulatory practices must evolve to ensure fairness, security, and efficiency in a data-driven environment. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.","Modern; RegTech; Regulator; Regulatory compliance; Technology","","","","","","","","World Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews, (2024); Finance Accounting Research Journal, (2024); Alam, Mahfooz, Introduction to green finance and technology integration, Harnessing Blockchain-Digital Twin Fusion for Sustainable Investments, pp. 1-19, (2024); Alam, Mahfooz, Introduction to Fintech in Industry 5.0: Companion or Antagonist, The Adoption of Fintech Using Technology for Better Security, Speed, and Customer Experience in Finance, pp. 1-16, (2024); Anagnostopoulos, Yiannis, Fintech and regtech: Impact on regulators and banks, Journal of Economics and Business, 100, pp. 7-25, (2018); Revolutionizing Compliance the Power of Regulatory Reporting Technology, (2024); Arner, Douglas W., FinTech, regTech, and the reconceptualization of financial regulation, Northwestern Journal of International Law and Business, 37, 3, pp. 373-415, (2017); Arner, Douglas W., RegTech: Building a Better Financial System, Handbook of Blockchain, Digital Finance, and Inclusion, Volume 1: Cryptocurrency, FinTech, InsurTech, and Regulation, pp. 359-373, (2017); OECD Going Digital Toolkit Notes, (2020); Asics Regtech Initiatives 201819, (2019)","S.

However, existing blockchain-based insurance prototypes often face limitations in transaction speed, cost efficiency, and scalability. This pilot study investigates a decentralised insurance platform implemented on the Algorand network, aiming to address these challenges. We focus on parametric insurance for flight delays, leveraging smart contracts and oracles to manage policy issuance, coverage activation, and claims. We conduct both sequential and stochastic simulations to evaluate performance under controlled and realistic transaction patterns. Our results show that average confirmation times drop from tens or hundreds of milliseconds, as seen in previous systems, to as low as 20 ms in sequential tests and approximately 6.60 ms in stochastic scenarios. Moreover, transaction fees remain minimal, improving cost-effectiveness by approx. 99.53% for claim operations compared to existing studies. The system sustains an average throughput of 44.44 TPS, with faster policy issuance and claims processing than comparable Ethereum-based solutions. These findings suggest that Algorand s Pure Proofof-Stake consensus and our architectural approach significantly enhance operational efficiency, supporting the feasibility of largescale decentralised insurance services. While scaling the experiment, exploring complex policies, and refining DAO governance structures are needed, this work provides a solid foundation for real-world adoption. This research supports blockchain-driven transformation in insurance markets and can serve as a step forward in Insurance 4.0. © 2025 IEEE.","Algorand; Blockchain; DAO; Decentralised Insurance; InsurTech; Parametric Insurance; RegTech/SupTech; Smart Contracts","Big data; Computer aided software engineering; Computer operating procedures; Cost effectiveness; Efficiency; Embedded systems; Insurance; Random processes; Smart contract; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Algorand; Block-chain; Cost-efficiency; DAO; Decentralised; Decentralized insurance; Insurtech; Parametric insurance; Pilot studies; Regtech/suptech; Blockchain","","","","","","","Zheng, Zibin, An Overview of Blockchain Technology: Architecture, Consensus, and Future Trends, Proceedings - 2017 IEEE 6th International Congress on Big Data, BigData Congress 2017, pp. 557-564, (2017); Gatteschi, Valentina, To Blockchain or Not to Blockchain: That Is the Question, IT Professional, 20, 2, pp. 62-74, (2018); Blockchain Technology Fundamentals Applications and Case Studies, (2026); Wüst, Karl, Do you need a blockchain?, Proceedings - 2018 Crypto Valley Conference on Blockchain Technology, CVCBT 2018, pp. 45-54, (2018); Loukil, Faiza, Ciosy: A collaborative blockchain-based insurance system, Electronics (Switzerland), 10, 11, (2021); Wei, Pengcheng, Blockchain data-based cloud data integrity protection mechanism, Future Generation Computer Systems, 102, pp. 902-911, (2020); Angelin Florence, A., A Decentralized Flight Insurance Smart Contract Application using Blockchain, Proceedings - 2023 3rd International Conference on Smart Data Intelligence, ICSMDI 2023, pp. 229-233, (2023); Gatteschi, Valentina, Blockchain and smart contracts for insurance: Is the technology mature enough?, Future Internet, 10, 2, (2018); Yan, Tan Choon, InsurTech and FinTech: Banking and Insurance Enablement, Handbook of Blockchain, Digital Finance, and Inclusion, Volume 1: Cryptocurrency, FinTech, InsurTech, and Regulation, pp. 249-281, (2018); Algorand, (2017)","L.

By applying fixed-effects panel regression and instrumental variable techniques, we ask whether AI adoption genuinely reduces illicit financial flows and improves anti-money laundering (AML) risk scores. The findings are mixed: while AI seems to support financial integrity in well-governed environments, its impact is far from universal. In weaker institutional settings, AI may be ineffective—or worse, exploited. Our analysis suggests that AI's potential lies not just in the technology itself, but in the regulatory and governance frameworks surrounding it. To be effective, AI tools must operate within transparent, accountable systems. Accordingly, we argue that AI investments should be accompanied by regulatory reform and global cooperation. This study contributes to policy debates by providing empirical cross-country evidence and a practical roadmap for integrating AI into financial governance in a responsible manner. © 2025, Sci. C.

Design/methodology/approach – This study combines a systematic literature review with content analysis to classify the selected sample into clusters and respective sub-clusters. Findings – This research identifies six clusters underscoring the pivotal role of CF to address the challenges that all “financial institutions” – banks, financial investment firms, insurance companies and other types of financial intermediaries, including those structured as FinTech companies – face to adopt provisions of the financial regulatory framework and to observe good operational practices. Research limitations/implications – The analysis mainly focuses on European institutions, making the results less applicable to other contexts with different financial systems and regulations. As a result, global compliance challenges, especially in emerging markets or less harmonised systems, may not be fully represented. Practical implications – From the perspective of financial institutions and regulatory authorities, this paper confirms the centrality of the CF in a dynamic environment, enhancing the organisation’s strategic resources. The results contribute to implementing best practices for the CF, thereby achieving efficiency, resilience, profitability and stability across all financial institutions. Social implications – The CF serves as a critical safeguard against banking crises by ensuring adherence to regulatory frameworks and fostering sound risk management practices. A robust compliance culture mitigates systemic and idiosyncratic risks, reducing the likelihood of misconduct and financial malfeasance that could lead to widespread economic consequences. Originality/value – This paper has highlighted which aspects of CF are most investigated in the literature, outlining a clear path of its activities and clearly recognising the strategic role in the organisations. © 2025 Federica Castro, Laura Leonori and Saverio Giorgio","Banking; Compliance function; Crisis management; Internal governance; RegTech; Regulatory compliance","","","","","","","","Ahmad, Sardar, Compliance or non-compliance during financial crisis: Does it matter?, International Journal of Finance and Economics, 28, 3, pp. 2348-2366, (2023); Aida, Neagoe, Corporate Governance in Romania: The Board Structure an Overview of Betplus Companies, Studies in Business and Economics, 17, 1, pp. 145-153, (2022); Anagnostopoulos, Yiannis, Fintech and regtech: Impact on regulators and banks, Journal of Economics and Business, 100, pp. 7-25, (2018); Arrigoni, Matteo, Proportionality in the European Banking Law.

It further investigates the conditions under which this disciplinary effect is strongest by analyzing the moderating roles of institutional ownership, analyst coverage and media attention. By exploring discussion topics and sentiment, this paper clarifies the dual function of these regulated platforms as both a transparency mechanism and a potential tool for market manipulation in an emerging market. Design/methodology/approach – This study matches insider trades from Chinese A-share firms (2019–2023) with Q&A data from exchange-run interaction platforms. Interaction intensity is proxied by the log of question counts and word counts over a 360-day pre-trade window. Insider profitability is measured by 30-day abnormal returns from a Fama-French five-factor model. The main relationship is identified using fixed-effects regressions with two-way clustered standard errors. A battery of robustness checks, including alternative return windows, a three-factor model and latent dirichlet allocation topic modeling and sentiment analysis, confirms the results and explores underlying mechanisms. Findings – Increased question volume and complexity on regulated platforms significantly reduce insider trading profits. This disciplinary effect is stronger in firms with lower institutional ownership and less analyst or media coverage, suggesting the platform acts as a substitute for traditional monitoring in opaque firms. Findings are robust to alternative specifications. Topic analysis reveals that discussions on strategy and projects are most effective at curbing insider gains. The evidence establishes these platforms as a credible external governance mechanism, although risks of strategic manipulation by insiders remain. Originality/value – This paper provides novel empirical evidence linking China’s exchange-sponsored Q&A platforms to insider-trading outcomes. By pairing trading records with platform interaction data and applying NLP techniques, we move beyond traditional disclosure proxies to capture transparency in real time. The findings extend the literatures on insider trading, RegTech and corporate governance by quantifying the conditions under which this digital disclosure is most effective. For regulators, the evidence supports algorithmic surveillance of these platforms as a cost-effective tool to enhance market integrity, especially for firms in opaque information environments. © 2025 Emerald Publishing Limited","Algorithmic governance; Information asymmetry; Insider trading; Natural language processing; RegTech","","","","","","","","Aboody, David, Earnings quality, insider trading, and cost of capital, Journal of Accounting Research, 43, 5, pp. 651-673, (2005); Anagnostopoulos, Yiannis, Fintech and regtech: Impact on regulators and banks, Journal of Economics and Business, 100, pp. 7-25, (2018); Anderson, Ronald C., Founding-Family Ownership and Firm Performance: Evidence from the S&P 500, Journal of Finance, 58, 3, pp. 1301-1327, (2003); Angel, James J., Insider Trading 2.0?

While advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning have been used to enhance compliance, the success of these efforts depends on a strong internal culture that prioritises regulatory compliance and a deep commitment to AML regulations. The author in this chapter identifies problematic cultural dynamics within banks that may hinder compliance, such as a ‘tick-box’ culture, resistance to change, a culture that fails to instil personal responsibility for AML and one that prioritises revenue generation over market integrity. Insights gathered from compliance officers indicate that while advanced technology aids businesses, it also poses risks of bad actors inventing ways to bypass AML controls. This chapter encourages banks to balance technological investment with a focus on cultivating the right cultural environment to effectively fight money laundering. The chapter offers valuable insights to better combat financial crime and ensure compliance with anti-money laundering regulations. © The Editors and Contributors Severally 2025.

This chapter examines the criteria for good evidence and data use within EU consumer law and policy, focussing on the evolving dynamics of e-commerce compliance. As digital transactions increase, ensuring consumer protection and trader compliance becomes increasingly complex. Consumer trust in e-commerce hinges on the effectiveness of legal frameworks. Over the past 30 years, EU consumer law has rapidly evolved, beginning with the Unfair Terms Directive 93/13, which addressed fairness in consumer contracts. Recent advancements, such as the Digital Content and Services Directive 2019/770 and the Sale of Goods Directive 2019/771, reflect a shift towards enhancing consumer rights in the digital age. The analysis focusses on whether the current legal framework adequately addresses e-commerce compliance nuances and how the evolution from the Unfair Terms Directive to the 2019 Directives has shaped the legal landscape. It delves into the deficiencies in understanding e-commerce compliance and how evidence and a data-driven approach can enhance legislative quality and efficiency. The chapter subsequently argues for an evidence-based and data-driven approach to EU consumer contract law. © The Editors and Contributors Severally 2025.","Digital governance; European consumer law; Evidence-based regulation; Law and technology; RegTech","Electronic commerce; Government data processing; Information systems; Information use; Software engineering; Data-driven approach; Digital age; Digital governance; E- commerces; European consumer law; European union; Evidence-based; Evidence-based regulation; Law and technology; Regtech; Consumer protection","","","","","","","Parkhurst, Justin Oliver, The Politics of Evidence: From evidence-based policy to the good governance of evidence, The Politics of Evidence: From Evidence-Based Policy to the Good Governance of Evidence, pp. 1-182, (2016); What Works Evidence Based Policy and Practice in Public Services, (2000); Hofmann, Herwig C.H., Automated Decision- Making in EU Public Law and Governance, Governance of Automated Decision- Making and Eu Law, pp. 289-305, (2024)","","","Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd.","","","","","","","9781035327089; 9781035327096","","","English","Empirics and Consumer Law in Changing Markets","Book chapter","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105021648666"

We highlight the emerging threat posed by quantum computing to TRISA's current cryptographic mechanisms, including RSA and ECDSA, which underpin identity verification, secure communication, and data confidentiality. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose a migration path integrating post-quantum cryptographic primitives standardized by NIST, specifically CRYSTALS-Kyber for key encapsulation and CRYSTALS-Dilithium for digital signatures. Our approach ensures the preservation of confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation in the quantum era, enabling TRISA to maintain regulatory compliance and trustworthiness.

The purpose of this study is to synthesize the existing body of knowledge from academic and gray literature – including insights from researchers, industry and governing authorities – to assess the capabilities enabled, challenges and limitations of using RegTech solutions for sustainability compliance. Design/methodology/approach – A multivocal literature review approach was applied to synthesize insights from academic literature and gray literature. We adopt an information systems capabilities lens to assess how RegTech supports sustainability-related compliance needs. Given that RegTech is an emerging field where much of the practical development and discussions about RegTech and compliance technologies occur outside academia, a multivocal literature review approach bridges the gap between academia and industry and ensures a comprehensive and holistic analysis. Findings – The findings reveal that RegTech enables automated compliance monitoring, and environmental, social and governance (ESG) risk management, enhances transparency in reporting and offers tools to mitigate greenwashing risks while also supporting sustainable investment and digital finance. In additon, varying maturity levels across platforms, high implementation costs and cybersecurity risks present further adoption challenges. Practical implications – To fully harness RegTech’s potential, interdisciplinary collaboration is crucial. Researchers in sustainability, finance, law, management and information systems should work together to develop frameworks, empirical studies and policy recommendations that address the operational, ethical and technical dimensions of RegTech. Strengthening partnerships between academia, industry and policymakers can help bridge the gap between conceptual research and practical implementation, ensuring that RegTech solutions are both effective and ethically sound. For industry, the integration of RegTech solutions presents a significant opportunity to improve sustainability compliance while reducing regulatory burden. Financial institutions, corporations and technology providers should prioritize investments in scalable and interoperable RegTech solutions that align with emerging regulatory and sustainability reporting standards such as the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation and global ESG disclosure standards. Originality/value – This study’s originality lies in its comprehensive synthesis of academic and gray literature to evaluate the role of RegTech in sustainability compliance, a critical yet unexplored topic.

As regulatory bodies struggle to enforce compliance in these fluid environments, current centralized RegTech solutions reveal inherent limitations in scalability, trust, and fault tolerance. This paper proposes a novel, real-time compliance verification framework using a decentralized multiagent system integrated with blockchain infrastructure. The system models regulatory rules using formal logic and distributes them across autonomous agents capable of real-time decisionmaking, trust-weighted consensus, and privacy-preserving validation through cryptographic techniques. Smart contracts ensure immutable auditability, while agent roles - validator, regulatory, and observer - coordinate seamlessly using FIPA-compliant communication protocols. Experimental evaluation demonstrates over 98 % compliance accuracy under normal conditions, sub200 ms verification latency, and resilience to agent dropouts and adversarial attacks. By removing single points of failure and enabling scalable, cross-jurisdictional rule enforcement, this framework offers a robust and transparent compliance solution for the next generation of decentralized financial systems. The approach sets a new benchmark in embedding regulatory intelligence within blockchain-based fintech, aligning technical scalability with legal accountability. © 2025 IEEE.","Blockchain; Decentralized Finance; Multi-Agent Systems; Real-Time Systems; RegTech; Regulatory Compliance; Smart Contracts; Trust Management","Autonomous agents; Compliance control; Decentralized finance; Decentralized systems; Decision making; Fintech; Formal logic; Intelligent agents; Interactive computer systems; Multi agent systems; Privacy-preserving techniques; Real time systems; Regulatory compliance; Scalability; Smart contract; Agent collaboration; Block-chain; Compliance verification; Decentralised; Multi agent; Multiagent systems (MASs); Real - Time system; Real- time; Regtech; Trust management; Blockchain","","","","","","","Wronka, Christoph, Financial crime in the decentralized finance ecosystem: new challenges for compliance, Journal of Financial Crime, 30, 1, pp. 97-113, (2023); Stan J Blockchain L Poly, (2024); Gulf Journal of Advance Business Research, (2025); Secure Transactions and Intelligent Advisory Systems Through AI Driven Automation and Scalable Data Architectures, (2021); Karim, Md Monjurul, AI Agents Meet Blockchain: A Survey on Secure and Scalable Collaboration for Multi-Agents, Future Internet, 17, 2, (2025); 17th International Rule Challenge and 7th Doctoral Consortium@ Ruleml Rr; Zetzsche, Dirk A., Decentralized finance, Journal of Financial Regulation, 6, 2, pp. 172-203, (2020); Kleijkers, Stefan, A mobile multi-agent system for distributed computing, Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (Subseries of Lecture Notes in Computer Science), 2530, pp. 158-163, (2003); Ahmad, Hafiz Farooq, Multi-agent systems: Overview of a new paradigm for distributed systems, Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on High Assurance Systems Engineering, 2002-January, pp. 101-107, (2002); Calvaresi, Davide, Real-time multi-agent systems: rationality, formal model, and empirical results, Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems, 35, 1, (2021)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Central China Normal University; IEEE; Science and Engineering Institute (SCIEI)","7th International Conference on Computer Communication and the Internet, ICCCI 2025","2025-09-27 through 2025-09-29","Tokushima","212921","28332342","9798350351767","","","English","Proc.

Recent literature suggests that such technologies represent more than just an efficiency tool; they mark a paradigm shift in regulation and the evolution of financial oversight (Kurum, 2023). This paper aims to provide a narrative review of recent RegTech applications in financial crime prevention, with a focus on key compliance domains. A structured literature review was conducted to examine publications between 2020 and 2024 with a thematic synthesis of findings related to customer due diligence (CDD) and know your customer (KYC), transaction monitoring, regulatory reporting and compliance automation, information sharing and cross-border cooperation, as well as cost efficiency. Findings reveal that RegTech solutions give financial institutions more responsibility for detecting and managing financial crime risks, making them more active players in compliance processes traditionally overseen by regulators. The combined use of technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and big data also generates synergistic effects that improve compliance outcomes beyond what these technologies achieve individually. This demonstrates the strategic relevance of integrated RegTech approaches. © 2025 The Authors.","AML-CFT; Compliance Automation; Financial Crime Detection; RegTech; Systematic Narrative Literature Review","","","","","","Centre National pour la Recherche Scientifique et Technique, CNRST","Acknowledgements: The first author sincerely acknowledges the CNRST (Centre National pour la Recherche Scientifique et Technique) in Morocco for the \u201CPhD-Associate Scholarship \u2014 PASS\u201D program.","Al-Ababneh, Hassan Ali, The Use of Artificial Intelligence to Detect Suspicious Transactions in the Anti-Money Laundering System, Theoretical and Practical Research in the Economic Fields, 15, 4, pp. 1039-1050, (2024); Intelligent Information Management, (2023); Global Academic Journal of Humanities and Social Sciences, (2020); Alkhalili, Mohannad, Investigation of Applying Machine Learning for Watch-List Filtering in Anti-Money Laundering, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 18481-18496, (2021); Al-Smadi, Arkan Walid, THE EXTENT OF COMMERCIAL BANKS’ READINESS TO IMPLEMENT BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY, Journal of Governance and Regulation, 12, S1, pp. 282-293, (2023); Anagnostopoulos, Yiannis, Fintech and regtech: Impact on regulators and banks, Journal of Economics and Business, 100, pp. 7-25, (2018); European Journal of Business and Management, (2015); Journal of Economics and Behavioral Studies, (2015); Arner, Douglas W., FinTech, regTech, and the reconceptualization of financial regulation, Northwestern Journal of International Law and Business, 37, 3, pp. 373-415, (2017); Arner, Douglas W., The Identity Challenge in Finance: From Analogue Identity to Digitized Identification to Digital KYC Utilities, European Business Organization Law Review, 20, 1, pp. 55-80, (2019)","","","Virtus Interpress","","","","","","27071111","","","","English","Corp.

The effect of the digital environment advances companies through free competition. However, compliance with AI and blockchain technologies requires significant time, effort, and money. The use of AI and blockchain technologies also demands users for sustainability. This study introduces the legal challenges of financial technologies focusing on AI and blockchain systems for business and consumers. In this chapter, the features and usage era of AI and blockchain technologies are analyzed through economic and legal perspectives. Considering transboundary transactions of blockchain and AI technologies and relevant risks, revision on AI or blockchain-relevant law should take both domestic and international measures into account. Companies preferring to use financial AI systems that involve high risk are proposed to use blockchain technologies for technical surveillance countermeasures. In this regard, blockchain and AI might be an effective way to secure both consumer’s privacy, personal data, and companies’ any data relevant to transaction against threats such as computer intrusion.

What happens when financial technology and regulatory technology startups encounter top-down administration? What roles can and should government take in steering market innovation in digital governance? We address these larger questions with the case of know-your-customer, and anti-money laundering and counter-the-financing-of-terrorism regulation in France. This case highlights tensions between two trends in the public administration of digital governance. First, it reveals the fine line that regulators tread in encouraging innovation while ensuring that know-your-customer and anti-money laundering and counter-the-financing-of-terrorism standards are applied to a widening array of corporations offering digital financial services. Government, and in our case French dirigisme, in the digital age, reflects continuities in the regulatory maintenance of sanctions, elaboration of legal requirements and hands on attempts to steer financial technology that go beyond a ""hands off"" approach where market actors self-govern. Second, and relatedly, the French case reveals how responsibility is nevertheless fostered onto increasingly smaller market actors that tend to be bought, sold or disappear quite rapidly. Our analysis points to important consequences for accountable governance and responsibility that require further exploration for understanding digital governance in democratic countries such as France. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Sarah Giest and Ian Roberge.

It highlights the opportunities and challenges faced by new age technology firms, especially in emerging markets, in ushering in business sustainability and provides insights to attain economic stability, growth, and social and environmental sustainability through FinTech and RegTech. Methodology: We conducted a systematic literature review using the SALSA (Search, Appraisal, Synthesis, and Analysis) framework to examine existing literature on the topic of the current study. To analyse the evolution and development of this domain, we extract published literature from Scopus using search strings based on the PICOC (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome and Context) framework population, without considering any time frame. Thematic synthesis is used for data extraction and further classification of literature to synthesize the current body of knowledge and ascertain future research agendas in FinTech, RegTech and sustainability. Finding: We find that FinTech has favourable influence on banks, SMEs and agriculture performance but is a significant challenger to the traditional finance industry. Although, there is suggestive evidence in favour of cyber security being a factor for FinTech adoption, further evidence is still required. Results highlight differences in market penetration of FinTech in developed and emerging economies, and demographic factors like the age of the population and demographic dividend of the emerging economies play an important role in the rise of FinTech in emerging economies. RegTech has continuously evolved to address the challenges posed by evolving financial technologies, with a focus on improving internal control systems. This study outlines the future research agenda in terms of protection against non-compliance, money laundering, terror financing, and cyber security, which are other major reasons for the adoption of RegTech. RegTech has also shown a positive impact on preventing financial crime, reducing compliance costs, and easy onboarding of clients. Practical implications: This paper reveals the connection between FinTech and RegTech and business sustainability, the factors that influence their adoption, and the challenges of adopting these technologies. The findings underscore the issues that policymakers must tackle to promote responsible FinTech adoption, striking a balance between innovation and sustainability. Originality: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study examining and presenting a structured literature review of the existing literature on the impact of FinTech/RegTech on business sustainability. © The Author(s) 2024.","Business sustainability; FinTech; RegTech; Systematic literature review","business; financial services; literature review; sustainability; technological development","","","","","","","Anagnostopoulos, Yiannis, Fintech and regtech: Impact on regulators and banks, Journal of Economics and Business, 100, pp. 7-25, (2018); Arner, Douglas W., FinTech, regTech, and the reconceptualization of financial regulation, Northwestern Journal of International Law and Business, 37, 3, pp. 373-415, (2017); Fenwick, Mark, Fintech and the financing of SMEs and entrepreneurs: From crowdfunding to marketplace lending, The Economics of Crowdfunding: Startups, Portals and Investor Behavior, pp. 103-129, (2018); Fintech by the Numbers Incumbents Startups Investors Adapt to Maturing Ecosystem, (2022); Finance Competitiveness and Innovation Global Practice Global Patterns of Fintech Activity and Enabling Factors Fintech and the Future of Finance Flagship Technical Note, (2022); Ssrn Electron J, (2021); International Journal of Global Business and Competitiveness, (2021); Ku-Mahamud, Ku Ruhana, Blockchain, cryptocurrency and Fintech market growth in Malaysia, Journal of Advanced Research in Dynamical and Control Systems, 10, 14, pp. 2074-2082, (2018); Mirza, Nawazish, The role of fintech in promoting green finance, and profitability: Evidence from the banking sector in the euro zone, Economic Analysis and Policy, 78, pp. 33-40, (2023); Role of Financial Management in Promoting Sustainable Business Practices and Development, (2019)","S.

This article introduces Ant, an open-source annotation software for regulatory compliance. Ant is designed to adapt to complex organizational processes and enable compliance experts to be in control of ML projects. By drawing on Business Process Modeling (BPM), we show that Ant can contribute to lift major technical bottlenecks to effectively implement regulatory compliance through software, such as the access to multiple sources of heterogeneous data and the integration of process complexities in the ML pipeline.

In this paper, we discuss the role of technologies in developing green finance. We identify that green finance faces three major challenges, including the risk management of green projects, the scarcity of innovative green financing products, and compliance with the regulations. Then, in the context of the existing literature, we explore recent technologies, including blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), data analytics, Internet of Things (IoT), and robotics that are helping to deal with the challenges in green finance. We show that data-driven approaches utilizing AI and ML help in the risk assessment of green projects; FinTech-based crowdfunding platforms provide innovative green financial products and regulatory technologies (RegTech) support in compliance with regulations. We also identify that the environmental footprint of cryptocurrencies is an emerging area in the technologies and green finance domain. Our framework could be helpful to further extend the debate on the role of technology in green finance. © 2024 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; crowdfunding; cryptocurrency; FinTech; green finance; machine learning; RegTech; risk management","","","","","","University of East London, UEL","Mitra acknowledges the financial support from The Royal Docks School of Business and Law, University of East London, through the Seed Funding Scheme April 2022.","Ahmad, Munir, Relating fiscal decentralization and financial inclusion to environmental sustainability: Criticality of natural resources, Journal of Environmental Management, 325, (2023); Ahmad, Sohail, The impact of CSR and green consumption on consumer satisfaction and loyalty: moderating role of ethical beliefs, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 30, 53, pp. 113820-113834, (2023); International Journal of Advanced Computer Research, (2019); Test Engineering Management, (2020); Allioui, Hanane, Exploring the Full Potentials of IoT for Better Financial Growth and Stability: A Comprehensive Survey, Sensors, 23, 19, (2023); Anagnostopoulos, Yiannis, Fintech and regtech: Impact on regulators and banks, Journal of Economics and Business, 100, pp. 7-25, (2018); Georgetown Journal of International Affairs, (2017); Arner, Douglas W., Sustainability, FinTech and Financial Inclusion, European Business Organization Law Review, 21, 1, pp. 7-35, (2020); Awawdeh, Alaeldin Eldin, Role of green financing and corporate social responsibility (CSR) in technological innovation and corporate environmental performance: a COVID-19 perspective, China Finance Review International, 12, 2, pp. 297-316, (2022); International Business Review, (2021)","B.N.

This paper proposes an unspent transaction output (UTXO)-based sharding method to address scalability challenges in RDCs. Results show UTXO-based sharding delivers linear throughput increase and consistently low latency by minimizing cross-shard transactions as the shard count grows. However, frequent user onboarding across shards under UTXO-based sharding models complicates know-your-customer (KYC) processes, highlighting regulatory inefficiencies. We demonstrate that zero-knowledge proofs seamlessly integrate with UTXO-based sharding to streamline customer onboarding and overcome regulatory burdens. Overall, this research pioneers FinTech-RegTech integration with practical implications for deploying high-performance, compliant RDC systems by synergistically combining UTXO-based sharding for scalability and zero-knowledge proofs for efficient regulation. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Financial technology (FinTech); Regulation; Regulatory technology (RegTech); Scalability","Electronic money; Customer on boardings; Financial technology; Low latency; Onboarding; Performance; Regulation; Regulatory technology; Technology Integration; Zero-knowledge proofs; Scalability","","","","","","","Available at Ssrn, (2023); Columbia Business Law Review, (2019); Hong Kong Monetary Authority and Kpmg Transforming Risk Management and Compliance Harnessing the Power of Regtech H K M A Whitepaper, (2020); Design Choices for Central Bank Digital Currency Policy and Technical Considerations, (2020); Jin, Siyuan, CEV Framework: A Central Bank Digital Currency Evaluation and Verification Framework With a Focus on Consensus Algorithms and Operating Architectures, IEEE Access, 10, pp. 63698-63714, (2022); Liu, Yizhong, Building blocks of sharding blockchain systems: Concepts, approaches, and open problems, Computer Science Review, 46, (2022); Zamani, Mahdi, RapidChain: Scaling blockchain via full sharding, Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 931-948, (2018); Huang, Huawei, BrokerChain: A Cross-Shard Blockchain Protocol for Account/Balance-based State Sharding, Proceedings - IEEE INFOCOM, 2022-May, pp. 1968-1977, (2022); Jin, Siyuan, A UTXO-based Sharding Method for Stablecoin, 2022 4th International Conference on Blockchain Computing and Applications, BCCA 2022, pp. 195-199, (2022); Feige, Uriel, ZERO KNOWLEDGE PROOFS OF IDENTITY., Conference Proceedings of the Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, pp. 210-217, (1987)","Y.

However, RegTech is mainly composed of the finance, regulatory and emerging technology sectors, and its business model involves multiple dimensions, such as those among governments, banks and technology companies and cross-border FinTech. Therefore, RegTech startups exhibit distinctive features, and the optimum business model for their operation needs to be rapidly determined. This study uses a business model canvas (BMC) as an example to configure the elements and determinants of a RegTech start-ups and applies the Delphi technique and multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) approaches for the analysis. The results indicate that ‘customer relations (CR)’ and ‘key activities (KA)’ are the most significant BMC elements. Additionally, the relevant top-ranked determinants are, in their order of importance, ‘Big Data analysis’, ‘system feasibility evaluation’, ‘long-term customization’, ‘data assessment and stakeholder descriptions’, and ‘short-term projects’. In particular, business models of RegTech are the most complex in FinTech. This study concludes with business elements that can be beneficial not only for RegTech advancement but also for other emerging technologies in the FinTech. © 2024","Business Model Canvas; Cloud Computing; FinTech; RegTech","Laws and legislation; Public relations; Business model canvas; Business models; Cloud-computing; Emerging technologies; Financial technology; Laws and regulations; Multiple dimensions; Regulatory technology; Technology fields; Technology sectors; Decision making","","","","","National Science and Technology Council, NSTC, (NSTC 111-2410-H-153 -037 -MY2); National Science and Technology Council, NSTC","The authors would like to thank the National Science and Technology Council, for the financial support under the contract: NSTC 111-2410-H-153 -037 -MY2.","Wang, Jensheng, Exploring biometric identification in FinTech applications based on the modified TAM, Financial Innovation, 7, 1, (2021); Verhoef, Peter C., Digital transformation: A multidisciplinary reflection and research agenda, Journal of Business Research, 122, pp. 889-901, (2021); Shiau, Wen Lung, Understanding fintech continuance: perspectives from self-efficacy and ECT-IS theories, Industrial Management and Data Systems, 120, 9, pp. 1659-1689, (2020); Wang, Jensheng, Reconfigure and evaluate consumer satisfaction for Open API in advancing FinTech, Journal of King Saud University - Computer and Information Sciences, 35, 9, (2023); Zhao, Jinsong, Riding the FinTech innovation wave: FinTech, patents and bank performance, Journal of International Money and Finance, 122, (2022); Journal of Entrepreneurial Finance, (2019); Acrn Journal of Finance and Risk Perspectives Special Issue Digital Accounting, (2019); Kurum, Esman, RegTech solutions and AML compliance: what future for financial crime?, Journal of Financial Crime, 30, 3, pp. 776-794, (2023); Anagnostopoulos, Yiannis, Fintech and regtech: Impact on regulators and banks, Journal of Economics and Business, 100, pp. 7-25, (2018); Teichmann, Fabian Maximilian Johannes, RegTech – Potential benefits and challenges for businesses, Technology in Society, 72, (2023)","J.-S.

Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative research methodology was used to identify the existing challenges. Literature was reviewed and analyzed, and seven experts were interviewed or consulted online and their feedback examined. The judgment of the case B2C2 Ltd v Quoine Pte Ltd. was reviewed. Findings: This study reveals a lack of relevant regulatory frameworks capable of meeting some of the evolving challenges, lack of awareness among market players and lack of expertise in RegTech. The list of additional challenges includes the issue of legacy technology, the weaknesses of human programmers and the need for a multifaceted solution for compliance requirements. Research limitations/implications: This study notes the novelty of RegTech in the financial world, especially in the Islamic financial market. Thus, there is a dearth of relevant literature. This study assists relevant conventional and Islamic financial market entities and authorities in determining the potential impact of RegTech on their respective businesses and the financial system. Practical implications: This study proffers recommendations to assist in addressing the challenges facing its users and paving the way for innovative solutions that will facilitate and enhance the use of RegTech in financial markets. Regulators and other stakeholders of the financial industry will learn from the challenges identified and can review the recommendations for adoption. Apart from that, the decision of B2C2 Ltd v Quoine has practical implications for RegTech users, as the court in B2C2 Ltd v Quoine accessed the “knowledge” of the programmers of deterministic software at the time of the coding. Originality/value: RegTech can offer cost-effective and efficient means to comply with regulations and ensure the accuracy of the information provided to regulators. This study provides a better understanding of the challenges associated with its use. The recommendations include enactment of a blueprint for a digitally enabled regulatory framework, creating awareness of RegTech via stakeholder roundtable discussions, development of human talent, formulating human governance standards and finding innovative ways to manage risks. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","B2C2 Ltd v Quoine Pte Ltd; Benefits; Challenges; RegTech","","","","","","(IF057A-2018)","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support provided by QRC plc and IBH (Research Grant number IF057A-2018).","Creating Enabling Fintech Ecosystems the Role of Regulators, (2020); Anagnostopoulos, Yiannis, Fintech and regtech: Impact on regulators and banks, Journal of Economics and Business, 100, pp. 7-25, (2018); Arner, Douglas W., FinTech, regTech, and the reconceptualization of financial regulation, Northwestern Journal of International Law and Business, 37, 3, pp. 373-415, (2017); Georgetown Journal of International Affairs, (2017); Baxter, Lawrence G., Adaptive financial regulation and regtech: A concept article on realistic protection for victims of bank failures, Duke Law Journal, 66, 3, pp. 567-604, (2016); Becker, Michael, RegTech—the application of modern information technology in regulatory affairs: areas of interest in research and practice, Intelligent Systems in Accounting, Finance and Management, 27, 4, pp. 161-167, (2020); Buckley, Ross P., The road to RegTech: the (astonishing) example of the European Union, Journal of Banking Regulation, 21, 1, pp. 26-36, (2020); Butler, Tom, Understanding RegTech for Digital Regulatory Compliance, Palgrave Studies in Digital Business and Enabling Technologies, pp. 85-102, (2019); Get with the Program Fintech Meets Regtech in the Light Touch Sandbox, (2017); Regtech Game Changer for Islamic Finance, (2020)","S.

Fintech denotes the close interaction between the financial services industry and latest information technologies like big data, cloud computing, blockchain, and artificial intelligence. Fintech has produced novel financial services, products, institutions, and business models. The Fintech revolution has brought enormous benefits for financial institutions and their consumers, such as cutting service costs, improving business efficiency, and enabling high-quality product options. Nonetheless, Fintech has posed multiple legal, ethical, and regulatory challenges for policy-makers and financial authorities regarding data security, consumer protection, and financial stability. This book attempts to accomplish three tasks. First, it provides readers with a better understanding of Fintech by examining its conceptual meanings, main forms, special features, and social values. Second, it investigates the complex, dynamic, and multidimensional Fintech ecosystem. It assesses global Fintech hubs in six continents, while discussing the ecosystem's key players like Fintech regulators (e.g., regulatory strategy, regulatory sandbox, and RegTech) and Fintech corporations (e.g., incumbent banks, financial holding companies, Fintech unicorns, BigTech firms, and Metaverse platforms). Third, this book conducts detailed Fintech case studies in three areas, including app-based banking, online P2P lending, and digital money and payment. It argues that Fintech contributes to a more equal, democratic, inclusive, and sustainable financial system. This book should appeal to a diverse readership across law, business, finance, computer science, and sociology disciplines, providing useful information for academics, university students, practitioners, policy-makers, and think tanks researching the global Fintech revolution. © Lerong Lu 2024.

To understand the effects on the financial sector, we study firms’ responses to new internal control requirements. Affected firms make significant investments in ERP and hardware. These expenditures then enable complementary investments that are leveraged for noncompliance purposes, leading to modest savings from avoided customer complaints and misconduct. IT budgets rise and profits fall, especially at small firms, and acquisition activity and market concentration increase.

RegTech has been used not only by financial industries but also by non-financial industries. On the other hand, Supervisory Technology (SupTech) is the use of technology to facilitate and enhance supervision activities and processes. RegTech and SupTech are underpinned by popular technologies, such as Big Data Analytics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, etc. However, it is hard to find RegTech / SupTech discussions in computer science or system information disciplines. Hence, no reference can guide an organization to develop RegTech/SupTech. Therefore, it is necessary to design a framework for developing RegTech/SupTech. The framework is developed using Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM). The proposed framework consists of nine components, i.e., regulation, risk management, environment constraint, functionality, technology, data, people, project strategy & management, and repository. Each of the components suggests recommended output(s) in order to develop a RegTech/SupTech. The proposed framework covers the components of existing frameworks and gives two additional components. Hence, this research contributes to provide an alternative framework for developing RegTech/SupTech. © Little Lion Scientific.","Development; Framework; Generic; RegTech; SupTech","","","","","","","","Arner, Douglas W., FinTech, regTech, and the reconceptualization of financial regulation, Northwestern Journal of International Law and Business, 37, 3, pp. 373-415, (2017); Anagnostopoulos, Yiannis, Fintech and regtech: Impact on regulators and banks, Journal of Economics and Business, 100, pp. 7-25, (2018); Turki, Meaad, The regulatory technology “RegTech” and money laundering prevention in Islamic and conventional banking industry, Heliyon, 6, 10, (2020); Du, Jingxiu, An analysis of regulatory technology in the Internet financial sector in conjunction with the logit model, Proceedings - 2020 2nd International Conference on Economic Management and Model Engineering, ICEMME 2020, pp. 428-431, (2020); Journal of Financial Transformation, (2016); Raso, Jennifer, Displacement as regulation: New regulatory technologies and front-line decision-making in Ontario works, Canadian Journal of Law and Society, 32, 1, pp. 75-95, (2017); Lallas, Efthimios N., An SQWRL-Based Method for Assessing Regulatory Compliance in the Pharmaceutical Industry, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 12, 21, (2022); Peters, Rob, Heathlands of digital health compliance, Pharmaceutical Care in Digital Revolution: Insights Towards Circular Innovation, pp. 195-210, (2019); Financial Authorities in the Era of Data Abundance Regtech Regulators and Suptech Solutions, (2018); Supervisory Technology Suptech, (2020)","","","Little Lion Scientific","","","","","","19928645","","","","English","J.

The pace of technological innovation and the ability of AI systems to think like human beings (simulate human intelligence), perform tasks independently, develop intelligence based on its own experiences and process layers of information to learn ever-complex representations of data (ML/DL) means that improvements in the rates at which this technology can undertake complex, technical and time-consuming tasks, identify people, objects, voices, patterns, etc., screen for ‘problems’ earlier, and provide solutions, provide astounding benefit in economic, political and social terms. The purpose of this paper is to explore advents in AI, ML and DL in the context of the regulatory compliance challenge faced by financial institutions in the United Kingdom (UK). Design/methodology/approach: The subject is explored through the analysis of data and domestic and international published literature. The first part of the paper summarises the context of current regulatory issues, the advents in deep learning, how financial institutions are currently using AI, and how AI could provide further technological solutions to regulatory compliance as of February 2023. Findings: It is suggested that UK financial institutions can further utilise AI, ML and DL as part of an armoury of solutions that ease the regulatory burden and achieve high levels of compliance success. Originality/value: To the best of the author’s knowledge, this is the first study to specifically explore how AI, ML and DL can continue to assist UK financial institutions in meeting the regulatory compliance challenge and the opportunities provided for financial institutions by the metaverse. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; English law; Machine learning; RegTech; Regulation","","","","","","","All persons who meet authorship criteria are listed as authors, and all authors certify that they have participated sufficiently in the work to take public responsibility for the content, including participation in the concept, design, analysis, writing, or revision of the manuscript.

Since then, it has become increasingly important to consider how financial institutions can maintain compliance with this constantly growing financial legal framework. The prospective use of RegTech solutions to assure legal compliance is examined in this presentation. RegTech is the application of technology to simplify compliance with and oversight of regulatory obligations. RegTech is nearly universally praised in modern legal doctrine as bearing the prospect of significant gains in terms of improved efficiency and less risk of human errors and ensuing administrative fines. Finally, this article highlights the critical function of the financial supervisor in the RegTech age as a liaison between legislators and financial institutions. RegTech does speed up the transition to a cooperative supervision model where the supervisor supports financial institutions in their quest for adequate and accurate compliance and where financial institutions provide supervisors with crucial input for the creation of effective standards, best practices, and RegTech solutions. © 2024 IEEE.","Automation; Compliance; Financial Sector; FinTech; RegTech; Regulation","Efficiency; Supervisory personnel; Banking industry; Compliance; Financial crisis; Financial institution; Financial sectors; Legal compliance; Legal frameworks; Prospectives; Regtech; Regulation; Decentralized finance","","","","","University of Bahrain","The author(s) would like to express gratitude to the University of Bahrain for their support.

To verify this claim, the present article takes a closer look at the role of the regulation of FinTech in the context of the regional cooperation in the Greater Bay Area (GBA). The GBA currently comprises the two Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macao and the nine municipalities in the Guangdong Province of the People's Republic of China (PRC), which together form one of the world's most dynamic and innovative regions. Based on each of the GBA members' unique legal systems, united under the principle of 'one country, two systems', the GBA can be regarded as a fertile testing ground, 'legal laboratory', or 'regulatory sandbox' for the regulation of FinTech worldwide. For this purpose, the article first introduces the existing legal framework, fleshing out the contours of the GBA. Second, it briefly outlines the current scope of FinTech and provides examples of its use in the GBA. The main focus of the article then shifts from FinTech to the regulatory challenges posed by FinTech in the GBA, and the article discusses how these may best be addressed by, for instance, relying on regulatory technology (RegTech) and so-called 'regulatory sandboxes'. The article concludes by arguing for both an early and a comprehensive discussion about the expected benefits and the potential risks of the rapid implementation and use of FinTech in the GBA and the world at large. © The Author(s) (2024).

The purpose of this paper is to develop theoretical provisions regarding trends and patterns of penetration of fintech into the financial system and the methodological basis for assessing the development potential of fintech at the country level in the context of financial development and economic growth. To achieve this goal, the paper analyzes data on fintech across 150 countries, presented by the Statista global data platform. Using theoretical methods of systematization and generalization, as well as empirical statistical methods, the geography of the spread of fintech was analyzed, identifying the factors of country leadership, and the areas of penetration of fintech were considered. As a result of the study, it was revealed that the modern methodology for monitoring and analyzing the development of fintech does not meet the requirements for analyzing the impact of this segment on financial development. In this regard, the article presents a system of indicators for assessing the development of fintech at the country level, and also explains the reasons why measuring the fintech market and dynamically assessing its development is still difficult in practice. Taking into account the identified shortcomings of the existing system of the fintech development indicators, additional indicators for measuring the development of the fintech sector at the national level are proposed, corresponding to the standard for assessing financial development. A study of Russian experience based on available data showed a high level of innovation in the payment sector and insurance. At the same time, the need to expand the implementation of domestic fintech solutions in the areas of asset management, Regtech and blockchain technologies was identified. © 2024 Financial University under The Government of Russian Federation.

A new technological trend is reshaping the financial industry, RegTech, marked by various advanced technological processes and automation. The main findings show that RegTech significantly reduces compliance costs, confirming its cost-saving potential. Therefore, Employee perceptions are critical to integrating and adopting RegTech within business operations. In addition, RegTech improves risk management systems with more accessible procedures and better internal controls. This proves RegTech's ability to improve the banking processes and strengthen the risk management system. Proportional to the organizational support, tool investments, and tool diversity interactions are moderated, and operational efficiency is enhanced. This research contributes significantly to the more profound knowledge of the implication of RegTech in the Saudi banking sector, which facilitates transformation through renewed practices in the industry alongside its efficiency. © 2024, World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

Based on a dataset of Chinese listed banks from 2015 to 2022, we initially employ a text-mining method to build the internal RegTech index from the banks’ annual reports. We subsequently reveal a significant mitigation effect of internal RegTech on bank liquidity risk. The finding remains robust after alleviating the endogeneity issue and under alternative proxy of the dependent variable and different sample periods. A possible channel is that internal RegTech boosts the regulatory capability and mitigates banks’ risky behaviours. Moreover, our results demonstrate some heterogeneities across RegTech subindices. The compliance and technological foundations subindices are more profound in affecting bank liquidity risk.

The work is focused on modelling content requirements found in the law, i.e., deontic rules prescribing that some information is contained in an official document. For such requirements, the main modelling effort revolves around the required content and its information types. We therefore designed a process to build a content model, elaborating design criteria for the model which partly depend on the use case encompassing compliance checking. We built the content model through iterative interactions between a knowledge engineer and domain experts designed to ensure that the model is not limited to representing only the letter of the law, but rather represents the relevant distinctions in the practice of compliance checking. We drew lessons learned regarding the need for setting up classification criteria for information types and handling the trade-off between expressivity and maintainability of the model. © 2024 IEEE.","Conceptual modeling; Legal compliance; Methodologies and tools; Regtech","Compliance checking; Conceptual model; Content modeling; Experience report; Financial supervisory; Information types; Legal compliance; Methodology and tool; Regtech; Supervisory authority; Requirements engineering","","","","","Canada Research Chairs; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC; Fonds National de la Recherche Luxembourg, FNR, (NCER22/IS/16570468/NCER-FT, CC BY 4.0); Fonds National de la Recherche Luxembourg, FNR; Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, (13/RC/2094-2); Science Foundation Ireland, SFI","This research was funded in whole, or in part, by the Luxembourg National Research Fund (FNR), grant reference NCER22/IS/16570468/NCER-FT.

A number of decentralized financial applications, such as lending, borrowing, trading, and asset management, have been made possible by the development of DeFi, which is made possible by the growth of block chain technology and smart contracts. Plat-forms that facilitate the instantaneous lending of huge sums of money by holders of cryptocurrency are known as decentralised finance lending platforms. There are few topics as hotly debated as the latest technical developments in the financial sector, which include banking, regulatory technology, cryptocurrencies, and digital assets. Smart contract sensitivity, hacking, centralization, and user mistake are some of the security problems in decentralised finance. The term “decentralised finance” refers to online financial services that use a public block chain. Technology known as block chain allows for decentralised finance. Users benefit greatly from decentralisation, transparency, and trustlessness, all of which are provided by decentralised finance. Automated protocols on block chains and stable coins enable users to borrow and lend money without the need for an intermediary via DeFi. One rapidly expanding aspect of the cryptocurrency monetary system is decentralized finance. A white paper describing a mechanism for peer-to-peer transactions is the genesis of the crypto asset boom. DeFi and Fintech have revolutionized the banking sector and made it easier for more people to access financial services. A DeFi market is a market where Financial Products that provide using decentralized applications are traded. Decentralized finance leverages key principles of decentralized block chain to increase financial security, unlock liquidity and growth opportunities and support an integrated and standardized economic system. This paper will explore the oppor-tunities and challenges presented by DeFi, as well as the regulatory implications for traditional financial systems. © The Author(s).","Block chain; Crypto currencies; Decentralized finance; Financial regulation; Fintech; RegTech; Stable coins","","","","","","","","O Reilly Media, (2018); Georgetown Journal of International Law, (2015); Rev Financ Stud, (2021); A Next Generation Smart Contract and Decentralized Application Platform, (2014); J Econ Perspect, (2020); Nber Working Paper no, (2020); J Financ Stab, (2022); Center on Economic and Financial Power, (2022); Stablecoins Risks Potential and Regulation, (2020); IEEE Trans Softw Eng, (2021)","H.

While initial AI applications focused on support functions, they evolved to help in decision-making over time. As web servers capture and collect a huge quantum of customer data, companies are taking advantage of artificial intelligence, big data analytics, and machine learning. The technology trio is helping financial companies, particularly startups, build innovative products, monitor, manage risk, and provide superior customer services. Indian startups made their mark by successfully demonstrating AI use cases that suit the Indian atmosphere. On the other hand, financial regulators promote and recommend using AI in a limited way (such as in regulator sandbox areas) that fosters innovative financial engineering and product development and brings in the safety and security of customer data and monies.

A two-step analytical regression approach on EViews 10 was used, which performs a one-factor analysis for each variable to identify the individual impact of each factor. A linear FMOLS approach was used to evaluate the cooperative effect of integration. The methodology was implemented on a dataset comprising 2,880 observations from 23 financial institutions in Jordan. The findings support the hypothesized dynamic interrelations between the essential Fintech factors relevant to the sustainable development of the financial sector, including significant and insignificant factors with the impact of inflation, which provides an adequate understanding of Fintech's evolution. Additionally, the outcomes consider post-2017 regulatory changes that reflect the role of supervision and regulation for the financial sector's flexibility and efficiency. Therefore, the results reveal the essential contribution of integrating decentralized finance applications, financial literacy, and regulatory technology to the development of Jordan's financial sector. Financial literacy serves as a facilitator, regulatory technology is a compliance enabler, and decentralized finance applications are driving forces of innovation and financial inclusion, ensuring a robust and sustainable financial ecosystem.

We also highlight past and current systemic weaknesses in the European Union and the United States. Accordingly, we present a conceptual framework for future regulatory reporting that enables near real-time banking supervision, opens new approaches to systemic risk monitoring, and incorporates cryptoassets seamlessly. By conducting a stakeholder analysis, we also accentuate this novel framework’s practical and operational challenges, where policymakers must play a moderating role in its implementation. © 2024 by World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.

This event represents a largely exogenous shock to corporate information dissemination technologies, resulting in a considerable reduction in information acquisition costs for investors. Using a difference-in-differences research design, we show that the cost of equity capital declines substantially after a firm switches from paper filing to mandatory electronic filing in EDGAR. The effect is stronger for small firms and firms with low analyst coverage and low institutional ownership. We identify three channels through which EDGAR affects a firm’s cost of capital: the liquidity, risk-taking, and corporate governance channels. EDGAR implementation also improves a firm’s investment efficiency significantly. We find evidence that the marginal value of a firm’s capital investment and cash is higher during the post-EDGAR period. © 2023 INFORMS.","corporate governance; cost of capital; EDGAR; information acquisition cost; liquidity; RegTech","Cost benefit analysis; Electric switches; Information dissemination; Investments; Search engines; Acquisition costs; Corporate governance; Cost of capital; Data retrieval; Electronic data gathering; Electronic data gathering, analyse, and retrieval; Information acquisition cost; Information acquisitions; Liquidity; Regtech; Risk management","","","","","(HKU R7054-18, T35/710/20R); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (72192841); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST, (107-2410-H-002-038-MY3, 110-2410-H-002-079-MY2); Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST; Universidade de Macau, UM, (MYRG2020-00259-FBA, SRG2019-00158-FBA); Universidade de Macau, UM","Funding:C.

The study addresses critical knowledge gaps regarding digitalization impacts across different financial subsectors, implementation barriers, and institution-specific adoption strategies within Kazakhstan's unique regulatory and market environment during 2021-2023. The research examines relationships between technological implementation intensity and institutional performance while identifying distinctive transformation patterns. The study employed mixed-methods research combining quantitative analysis of financial performance metrics from 27 Kazakhstani financial institutions (representing 83.7% of sector assets) with qualitative assessments from 45 senior executive interviews. Research instruments included a Digital Transformation Index measuring implementation across 37 distinct indicators in four domains (customer interface, operational systems, analytics capabilities, regulatory compliance). The findings reveal Kazakhstan's financial sector has achieved 57.4% of estimated digitalization potential with significant institutional variation. Payment providers demonstrate the highest implementation levels, while microfinance institutions show the lowest ones. Digital payment adoption increased 186% since 2020, with stark urban-rural disparities (72.3% vs. 31.7%). Institutions in the highest implementation quartile demonstrate 70.8% better profitability metrics and 30.5% improved operational efficiency compared to lowest-implementing counterparts. Implementation challenges include talent scarcity, data quality issues, and integration complexity. © CC BY 4.0.","Banking; Central Asian Finance; Digital Payments; Digital Transformation; Financial Inclusion; Financial Technology; Kazakhstan; Regulatory Technology","","","","","","","","Alibekova, G.

In this paper, we provide the first empirical analysis of CSCS scores in Zhejiang province, as the Zhejiang provincial government is to date the only local government to publish the scores of locally registered firms. We find that while the CSCS is ostensibly a means of measuring legal compliance, politically connected firms receive higher scores. This result is driven by a ""social responsibility""category in the scoring system that valorizes awards from the government and contributions to causes sanctioned by the Chinese Communist Party. Our analysis underscores the potential of the CSCS to nudge corporate fealty to partystate policy and provides an early window into the far-reaching potential implications of the CSCS. © The Author(s), 2023.

Supervision is measured by how compliant an organization is in complying with statutory regulations. Currently checking data is only limited to data retrieval. Accelerated regulatory changes in government can create legal issues if organizations are unable to meet regulatory compliance. Limited Human Resources (HR) in analyzing the many regulations and limited inspection time result in less-than-optimal quality of supervision. Supervisors oversee complex problems and often have difficulty obtaining data and information to analyze to produce fast, efficient, and effective decisions. The current monitoring system runs on a computer-based system, but there are still many opportunities for improvement. Some opportunities that can be implemented include (1) end-to-end integration of all processes, (2) use of technology to check data validity, (3) reduction of approval processes, (4) early warning systems, and so on. The supervisory process of the Financial Services Authority (OJK, Otoritas Jasa Keuangan) has begun and the concept of implementing Regulatory Technology (RegTech) and Supervisory Technology (SupTech) has begun in an integrated manner on the supervisory and regulatory industry side. The results of the literature study have not answered the standard architectural solutions that can be used as a reference for monitoring solutions in government agencies. In this research, a similar solution is designed for monitoring processes in government agencies. In this research, a solution architecture artifact was designed for a monitoring system in government institutions. The chosen methodology is Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM). The designed solution is represented by adopting the 4-layer divisions used in Enterprise Architecture (EA), namely the business layer, data layer, application layer, and technology layer. Testing takes the form of measuring compliance with requirements and simulating business processes to predict the impact on the performance of the system being designed. © 2023 Little Lion Scientific.","Architecture; Government; RegTech; SupTech; Technology","","","","","","","This paper was supported by a scholarship from The Ministry of Communication and Information of the Republic of Indonesia.","Dasar Dasar Manajemen, (2019); Data E Government Development Index United Nation, (2022); Arner, Douglas W., FinTech, regTech, and the reconceptualization of financial regulation, Northwestern Journal of International Law and Business, 37, 3, pp. 373-415, (2017); Sound Practices Implications of Fintech Developments for Banks and Bank Supervisors, (2018); Internal Auditing Assurance Advisory Services 4th, (2017); Hidayat-ur-Rehman, Imdadullah, The role of awareness in appraising the success of E-government systems, Cogent Business and Management, 10, 1, (2023); Dong, Xinyu, How adoption is G2B model E-Government?

Blockchain may be used by organizations of all sizes to improve their security, privacy, and data transparency. The term ""Industry 4.0"" describes the integration of several cutting-edge manufacturing methods that accelerate the pace at which enterprises may achieve their objectives. Research on the potential for substantial disruptions brought on by a wide range of Industry 4.0 technologies has been conducted in recent years. These technologies include Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, and Blockchain. The industrial and supply chain sectors, among others, benefit greatly from these technological advancements. Blockchain has garnered a lot of interest because of its potential to enhance the business climate of supply chains and factories. Blockchain's interesting advantages have recently been widely appreciated by experts in several sectors. In this piece, we explore the profound possibilities of blockchain in the context of Industry 4.0. Several key aspects of Blockchain technology, including its drivers, enablers, and associated capabilities, are dissected to conclude. The authors have concluded their work by identifying key Blockchain-based Industry 4.0 use cases. Several recent innovations and the promise of immense potential are driving the development of Industry 4.0. Each component of this technology would boost the process individually and together provide superior outcomes. As a result, this would have farreaching effects on the development of new business models, some of which might be quite different from the ones now in use. © 2024 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Although there are different frameworks for conducting RIA, they are only applicable to regulations whose impact can be measured with structured data. Yet, a significant and increasing number of regulations require firms to comply by specifying and communicating textual data to consumers and supervisors. Therefore, we develop a methodological framework for RIA in case of unstructured data following the design science research paradigm. The framework enables the application of textual analysis and natural language processing to assess the impact of regulatory actions that result in unstructured data and offers guidance on how to map suitable methods to the dimensions impacted by the regulation. We evaluate the framework by applying it to the European financial market regulation MiFID II, specifically the recent regulatory changes regarding best execution. Thereby, we show that MiFID II failed to improve informativeness and comprehensibility of best execution policies. © 2022, The Author(s).","Design science; Natural language processing; RegTech; Regulatory impact analysis; Textual analysis; Unstructured data","","","","","","Data Science Institute, Columbia University, DSI; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (946602)","Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

The questionnaire was created using a 5-point Likert scale, and we received 181 responses. The data was analyzed with a ""Structural Equation Model""(SEM) using SmartPLS3. All hypotheses were tested and along with all the latent variable relationships. The results reveal that a compulsion to use these services in times of global crisis significantly influences user's attitude toward Fintech adoption.

It is used to solve regulatory and compliance issues more effectively and efficiently. Regulators with the digitization of regulation and datafication of processes would get empowered to manage volumes of data. RegTech would assist them in understanding innovative products, transactions, risks, reporting and any market manipulation activities in real time. For successful use of RegTech, the regulatory framework of a country should be comprehensive to address issues that may arise in the use of RegTech. Thus, the purpose of this article is to analyze the adequacy of the Saudi Arabian legal framework to address RegTech adoption. Design/methodology/approach: The researcher using logical analysis method analyzed the available laws and interpreted the law to see the applicability and the adequacy of laws to regulate the use of RegTech in Saudi Arabia. The content analysis was also used in this research to analyze the literature. This analysis helped to explain the available literature on the research topic and its relevancy and the gap in literature. Findings: The analysis using the logical and content methodologies shows that Saudi Arabia has general law to address some of the issues that might arise in the adoption of RegTech. Nonetheless, amending some of the existing laws or introducing guidelines could help better uplift of RegTech and similar technologies in Saudi Arabia. Originality/value: As businesses and regulatory authorities embrace technology for better and efficient delivery of services and products in Saudi Arabia, the research is timely to analyze the adequacy of the laws in Saudi Arabia for adoption of RegTech. In the use of RegTech, issues related to privacy, due diligence, accountability and transparency could arise, however, there is a dearth of literature in these areas relating to technology adoption. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adequacy; Amendment; Compliance; Law; Privacy; Regulatory technology","","","","","","Prince Sultan University, PSU, (EASYCHAIRNUMBER-104)","Funding Information: This work was supported by Seed Project Grant; Prince Sultan University; Saudi Arabia [EASYCHAIRNUMBER-104].","San Diego Business Journal, (2014); Role of Competition Law in the Telecommunications Sector in Saudi Arabia, (2025); Al-Qahtani, Shahad, THE ROLE OF THE LEGAL FRAMEWORKS IN ATTRACTING FOREIGN INVESTMENTS: THE CASE OF SAUDI ARABIA, Access to Justice in Eastern Europe, 6, special issue, pp. 1-17, (2023); Northwestern Journal of International Law Business, (2016); Arner, Douglas W., FinTech, regTech, and the reconceptualization of financial regulation, Northwestern Journal of International Law and Business, 37, 3, pp. 373-415, (2017); Journal of Financial Transformation, (2016); Bajwa, Ishtiaq Ahmad, Past, Present and Future of FinTech Research: A Bibliometric Analysis, SAGE Open, 12, 4, (2022); Digitizing Financial Regulation Regtech as A Solution for Regulatory Inefficiency and Ineffectiveness Working Paper Series no, (2020); International Journal of Arts Sciences, (2019); A Critical Look at the Regulation of Cybercrime A Comparative Analysis with Suggestions for Legal Policy, (2005)","J.

This article explores the opportunities for using modern tools of data access and sharing to embed regulatory objectives within the management and decision-making processes of financial firms. This can enhance oversight of prudential and conduct risks as well as substantially lowering compliance costs. It can also help address the information imbalances that limit the effectiveness of older approaches in which the firm is a 'black box' that can only be externally supervised. The central challenge is establishing an appropriate governance of data in regulated firms to ensure the achievement of both regulatory and business objectives. Such an approach can be viewed as a further and more radical development of established 'new governance' techniques of financial regulation. © 2023 The Author(s).

This paper addresses the following questions: How do commercial banks in developing countries like Lebanon respond to institutional pressures for compliance concerning anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-financing of terrorism (CFT)? How do Regulatory Technology (RegTech) solutions contribute to solving their compliance problems in this domain and why may the potential of RegTech be limited in the Lebanese context? To answer these questions, we conducted a field study among Lebanese commercial banks and their vendors. Based on thematic analysis, findings reveal the importance of technology for enhancing compliance of Lebanese banks with international regulations, especially US ones, thereby avoiding sanctions. Thus, the adoption of RegTech is mainly due to coercive pressures, whereas the choice of RegTech solutions is highly dependent on mimetic and normative forces, and happens later. Results also show that manual processes are insufficient for compliance due to the huge number of regulations and transactions. Hence, RegTech for AML/CFT is notably adopted for the efficient screening of clients and monitoring of their transactions. These solutions enhance decision-making processes for compliance teams, which become effective when the banks ensure an adequate interaction between employees and the new technologies. However, RegTech presents several additional challenges that have to be overcome for effective compliance such as finding the right vendors and ensuring data quality. Moreover, the geopolitical context in developing countries like Lebanon limits the potential of RegTech for AML/CFT. © Association for Information Technology Trust 2023.","compliance; developing countries; dollarized economy; financial crime; Lebanese commercial banks; money laundering; neo-institutional theory; Regulatory technology; sequential adoption theory","Behavioral research; Decision making; Finance; Laundering; Regulatory compliance; Terrorism; Anti-money laundering; Commercial bank; Compliance; Dollarized economy; Financial crime; Lebanese commercial bank; Lebanon; Neo-institutional theories; Regulatory technology; Sequential adoption theory; Developing countries","","","","","","","Addo, Atta A., INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES: EVIDENCE FROM GHANA CUSTOMS, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 45, 4, pp. 1833-1862, (2021); Al-Suwaidi, Noura Ahmed, Anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing: a survey of the existing literature and a future research agenda, Journal of Money Laundering Control, 24, 2, pp. 394-424, (2020); Aziz, Saqib, Machine Learning and AI for Risk Management, Palgrave Studies in Digital Business and Enabling Technologies, pp. 33-50, (2019); Bamberger, Kenneth A., Technologies of compliance: Risk and regulation in a digital age, Texas Law Review, 88, 4, pp. 669-739, (2010); undefined, (2018); Braun, Virginia, Using thematic analysis in psychology, Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3, 2, pp. 77-101, (2006); Burdon, Wendy Mason, Institutional Theory and Evolution of ‘A Legitimate’ Compliance Culture: The Case of the UK Financial Service Sector, Journal of Business Ethics, 162, 1, pp. 47-80, (2020); Butler, Tom, Understanding RegTech for Digital Regulatory Compliance, Palgrave Studies in Digital Business and Enabling Technologies, pp. 85-102, (2019); Canhoto, Ana Isabel, Leveraging machine learning in the global fight against money laundering and terrorism financing: An affordances perspective, Journal of Business Research, 131, pp. 441-452, (2021); Ciesielska, Malgorzata, Qualitative methodologies in organization studies, Qualitative Methodologies in Organization Studies, 2, pp. 1-264, (2017)","H.

Such technologies rely on collecting exclusive information from the environment and humans through automated Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and self-reported data. The key enablers of RegTech are the increased capabilities and reduced cost of IoT and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies. This article focuses on a survey of RegTech, highlighting the recent developments in various sectors. This work identifies the characteristics of existing implementations of RegTech applications in the financial industry. It examines the critical features that non-financial industries such as agriculture must address when using such technologies. We investigate the suitability of existing technologies applied in financial sectors to other industries and the potential gaps to be filled between them in terms of designing information systems for regulatory frameworks. This includes identifying specific operational parameters that are key differences between the financial and non-financial sectors that can be supported with IoT and AI technologies. These can be used by both producers of goods and services and regulators who need an affordable and efficient supervision method for managing relevant organizations. © 2023 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; IIoT; internet of things; machine learning; RegTech; regulatory technologies","Engineering education; Finance; Information systems; Information use; Machine learning; Regulatory compliance; Artificial intelligence technologies; Financial industry; Financial sectors; IIoT; Machine-learning; Network-based; Regulatory technology; Technology challenges; Technology opportunities; Internet of things","","","","","","","Grassi, Laura, RegTech in public and private sectors: the nexus between data, technology and regulation, Journal of Industrial and Business Economics, 49, 3, pp. 441-479, (2022); Firmansyah, Benny, A Systematic Literature Review of RegTech: Technologies, Characteristics, and Architectures, 2022 International Conference on Information Technology Systems and Innovation, ICITSI 2022 - Proceedings, pp. 310-315, (2022); Journal of Financial Transformation, (2017); Gasparri, Giorgio, Risks and Opportunities of RegTech and SupTech Developments, Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence, 2, (2019); Journal of Banking and Financial Economics, (2021); Schueffel, Patrick, Taming the beast: A scientific definition of fintech, Journal of Innovation Management, 4, 4, pp. 32-54, (2016); Financial Stability Implications from Fintech, (2017); Safaricom; Puschmann, Thomas, Fintech, Business and Information Systems Engineering, 59, 1, pp. 69-76, (2017); Suryono, Ryan Randy, Challenges and trends of financial technology (Fintech): A systematic literature review, Information (Switzerland), 11, 12, pp. 1-20, (2020)","A.

This study aimed to provide an overview of the global AML/CFT regulations, application and how they should evolve in this dynamic environment. To gather more insight, a qualitative study was undertaken with relevant documents analysed. The main finding was that country implementation of the global AML/CFT regulations differed due to political and economic factors, amongst others. While the various AML/CFT enforcements done by sampled countries were mainly cease and desist orders and monetary penalties that were publicised, the drawbacks of global AML/CFT regulations centred on the application of these regulations and emerging trends. These include, among other definitions of money laundering, reference to the three stages of money laundering, the link between penalty and violations, technological innovations and regulation paradigm shift, cyber-attacks, and data privacy. This study contributes to the application and growing body of knowledge in that the advent of technology has resulted in better consumer experiences, new payment platforms, products and services. However, these innovations have broadened emerging money laundering risks and risks to the financial system in general. Hence, there is a need to conduct research-based FATF recommendations, as risk is dynamic and not static. © 2023 by the authors.","AML/CFT; banking regulations; FATF; FinTech; money laundering; RegTech; risk","","","","","","University of South Africa, Unisa","The APC was funded by the University of South Africa.","ABA Legal Technology Survey Report 2020, (2020); Journal of Marketing and Consumer Research, (2015); Alldridge, Peter W., Money Laundering Law: Forfeiture, Confiscation, Civil Recovery, Criminal Laundering and Taxation of the Proceeds of Crime, Money Laundering Law: Forfeiture, Confiscation, Civil Recovery, Criminal Laundering and Taxation of the Proceeds of Crime, pp. 1-282, (2003); Al-Nuemat, Ahmed Adnan, Money laundering and banking secrecy in the Jordanian legislation, Journal of International Commercial Law and Technology, 9, 2, pp. 117-126, (2014); Journal of Legal Ethical and Regulatory Issues, (2022); Anagnostopoulos, Yiannis, Fintech and regtech: Impact on regulators and banks, Journal of Economics and Business, 100, pp. 7-25, (2018); Social Science Research Network, (2020); Journal of Economics and Behavioral Studies, (2015); Araujo, Ricardo Azevedo, An evolutionary game theory approach to combat money laundering, Journal of Money Laundering Control, 13, 1, pp. 70-78, (2010); Proceedings of the 7th European Conference on Research Methodology for Business and Management Studies Ecrm2008, (2008)","A.B.

RegTech automates various regulatory compliance activities that were previously manual, such as regulatory interpretation and regulatory reporting, amidst the challenges of the increasing volume of regulations and operational data. Some cutting-edge technologies discovered at RegTech include big data analytics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotic process automation, and cloud computing. Although very dominant in the financial industry, RegTech solutions have the potential to be applied in other regulated industries besides finance. Several studies have explored the potential for applying RegTech in industries other than finance, such as charitable organizations, real estate marketplace, pharmaceuticals, and healthcare. Therefore, this study aims to design a generic RegTech solution architecture so that it can be adopted and applied in various regulated industries achieve regulatory compliance more efficiently. Based on the evaluation results, the proposed architecture can be applied in an industrial environment other than financial to be considered generic. Furthermore, an evaluation of the comparison of regulatory compliance business processes without and by implementing RegTech can produce a time efficiency of 95.16%. These results show that RegTech solutions can achieve regulatory compliance more efficiently. © 2023 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

In Europe, concerns about data-driven market power have led policymakers to propose far-reaching regulations of information technology (IT) in these markets. Despite the global policy relevance, the regulation of big data and its competitive effects has so far received little attention in information systems (IS) research. This article addresses this research gap by developing an overarching framework for future IS research on the role of IT for the regulation of data-driven market power. The proposed research framework builds upon a three-part analysis: First, we review the academic literature and show that there is extensive, although nuanced, empirical evidence for business value creation from big (user) data. Second, we draw on the resource-based view of the firm and recent policy reports to derive six facilitating factors that enable firms to establish market power based on sustained data-driven competitive advantages. Third, we characterize three regulatory approaches to govern market power and competition in data-driven digital markets: (i) empowering consumers, (ii) data openness, and (iii) limiting data scale. For each of these approaches, we highlight the key role of IT artifacts in mediating the effect of regulatory rules on actual practice. © Association for Information Technology Trust 2023.","Big data; competition in digital markets; data-driven business value; digital platforms; economics of IS; internet economy; IT artifacts; market power; policy; RegTech; regulation of IT","Big data; Commerce; Business value; Competition in digital market; Data driven; Data-driven business value; Digital markets; Digital platforms; Economic of information system; Economics of information; Information technology artifact; Internet economy; Market Power; Regtech; Regulation of information technology; Competition","","","","","","Funding text 1: We are grateful to the Special Issue Editors, especially Kalle Lyytinen for helpful guidance in the review process, and two anonymous referees for their valuable feedback and suggestions.

Regulatory Technology (RegTech) is an important part of effectively preventing money laundering and terrorism financing. However, the implementation of RegTech related to the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, especially in the Indonesian banking sector, has not been widely studied and discussed. Therefore, this study aims to provide empirical testing evidence regarding the effectiveness of RegTech implementation in the Indonesian banking sector to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses primary data obtained through a survey distributed to 160 bankers who work in eight different banks in Indonesia with a 95% confidence level and a confidence interval of 7.75. The criteria needed to determine the sample in this study are individuals who actively work as staff whose work is directly related to banking; individuals who are actively working in banks registered with OJK; individuals who have been actively working in the banking sector in Indonesia for at least three years. The data that has been obtained were analyzed using the SmartPLS application to test the validity and reliability, descriptive statistics and structural models (inner model). Findings: The results of this study indicate that electronic know your customer (eKYC), transaction monitoring (TM), cost and time efficiencies (CTE) influence the prevention of anti-money laundering (AML) and countering financing of terrorism (CFT) in the Indonesian banking sector. However, eKYC and CTE have little influence on AML-CFT in the Indonesian banking sector. Meanwhile, TM has a moderate influence on AML-CFT in the Indonesian banking sector. In addition, in general, most bankers agree that the bank they work for has followed the guidelines, policies and regulations that have been given. Originality/value: This study uses the Indonesian banking sector as a research subject that raises the effectiveness of the implementation of the use of RegTech to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Banking; Banking money laundering terrorist financing; Money laundering; Regulatory technology (RegTech); Terrorist financing","","","","","","Binus University, BINUS","Funding statement: This study is supported by BINUS University 2022 funding, as a part of Research Grant of Proyek Inisiatif BINUS (BINUS Initiative Project) entitled “Publikasi International Bereputasi, Hak Kekayaan Intelektual dan Multidisiplin Research Output dalam Integrated Catur Dharma Perguruan Tinggi” or “Reputable International Publication, Intellectual Property Rights and Multidisciplinary Research Output in Integrated Catur Dharma College”.","Study Guide Cams Certification Exam, (2016); Akter, Shahriar, An evaluation of PLS based complex models: The roles of power analysis, predictive relevance and GoF index, 17th Americas Conference on Information Systems 2011, AMCIS 2011, 2, pp. 1313-1319, (2011); Anagnostopoulos, Yiannis, Fintech and regtech: Impact on regulators and banks, Journal of Economics and Business, 100, pp. 7-25, (2018); Third Round Mutual Evaluation Report, (2018); Arner, Douglas W., FinTech, regTech, and the reconceptualization of financial regulation, Northwestern Journal of International Law and Business, 37, 3, pp. 373-415, (2017); Blueprint Sistem Pembayaran Indonesia 2025 Bank Indonesia Menavigasi Sistem Pembayaran Nasional Di Era Digital, (2019); Anti Pencucian Uang Dan Pencegahan Pendanaan Terorisme, (2020); Basel Aml Index 9th Public Edition Ranking Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Risks Around the World, (2020); Fintech Development and Regulatory Frameworks in Indonesia, (2019); Butler, Tom, Understanding RegTech for Digital Regulatory Compliance, Palgrave Studies in Digital Business and Enabling Technologies, pp. 85-102, (2019)","M.

Fintech is rapidly expanding because of government legislation, multiple schemes, consumer expectations, a cashless economy, digitisation, globalisation, innovation, and other drivers. Need for the Study: Fintech firms are forming alliances with traditional financial organisations to stay afloat and compete. India is becoming a superpower regarding e-startups, especially unicorns. Many startups are undergoing initial public offerings (IPOs). Fintech is an emerging space in India, spreading its wings rapidly in every sector. Methodology: This work is based on a literature review. It utilises secondary data from numerous research publications, magazines, newspapers, published reports, relevant websites, Forbes magazine articles, stories from The Economic Times, the RBI Portal, and information from StartupIndia, Assocham, and Pwc, among others, to develop a conceptual framework showing the growth drivers of Fintech. Findings: The whole world has been affected severely due to COVID-19. Crisis always comes with some opportunity, and it is up to us how to turn the calamities into opportunities that further turn into innovation that has the power to lead the world. Fintech is that fruit that had been born normally but grew abnormally (tremendous growth) during the pandemic. Also, the roots are so deeper that they will flourish more and more. It has been found that the emergence of a cashless economy, ease of internet connectivity, etc., are the major factors that paved the way for growth for Fintech in India. Practical Implications: This study contains the conceptual framework which can guide the stakeholders, policymakers, management teams, field experts, etc., in knowing about their area expertise and looking for improvement, if any. Originality: There are many papers on the relationship between Fintech and financial inclusion, but this is the first study that builds the conceptual framework for the growth drivers of Fintech. © 2023 by Shreya Arora and Pankaj Madan.","Blockchain; Digital wallets; Fintech; Insurtech; RegTech; Startups; Unicorns","","","","","","","","Outlook of Fintech in India for Various Business Models in 2022, (2022); Future of Robo Advisors in Investment and Wealth Management, (2020); Our Heritage, (2020); Evolution of Fintech A New Post Crisis Paradigm, (2015); Financial Services Unchained the Ongoing Rise of Open Financial Data, (2021); Rsm India Partnering with the Bfsi Sector for Resilience and Growth, (2021); Fintech for the Underserved Future of Fintech and Payments to Drive Financial Inclusiveness, (2021); Consumers International, (2017); An Introduction into Fintech Key Sectors and Trends, (2016); Innovations in Retail Payments, (2012)","","","Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.","","","","","","","9781804555620; 9781804555637","","","English","Contemp.

Design/methodology/approach: Based on two online Delphi surveys sent to a panel of international experts composed of eight specially recruited professionals and specialists of anti-financial crime compliance and RegTech, five main predictions have been developed. Findings: It was found that artificial intelligence would become the most impactful technology for financial institutions to fight financial crime, and that there will be a strong positive correlation between ever-more elaborated compliance programs and the level of sophistication of methods used for money laundering. Furthermore, the panel designated regulators’ recommendations as likely to be less influential than RegTech solutions, and the time required to integrate RegTech solutions for AML compliance as the main future challenge. Originality/value: These predictions are meant to provide financial institutions and regulators with useful outlooks.

The paper appraises how key features of EU and UK regulatory and policy initiatives can contribute to a functional framework for RegTech and SupTech. Design/methodology/approach: The paper refers to the most comprehensive empirical findings within the EU and the UK on RegTech and SupTech, including reports released by the European Banking Authority and the Bank of England. As data is only gradually becoming available about the true rate of adoption of RegTech and SupTech, the paper identifies salient areas that warrant analysis from emerging findings. In light of the relatively restricted sources of empirical data, the article’s methodological approach is directed towards the most wide-ranging and detailed sources that are currently available at EU and UK levels. Findings: The paper reveals distinct variations in how the EU and UK have pursued regulatory approaches towards RegTech and SupTech growth. However, there are many shared features in the respective approaches. The paper argues that a regulatory framework should ideally be imbued with overarching strategies and policy objectives, as well as with practical measures through innovation facilitators, such as sandboxes. Yet, legislative (top-down) intervention will be the significant ingredient in guaranteeing legal clarity for RegTech and SupTech. Originality/value: By understanding the nuances in EU and UK approaches, the paper advocates for pragmatic reasoning when formulating a regulatory response. The importance of the article is in its focus on the elements of EU and UK regulatory approaches that are most capable of guaranteeing clarity on standards relating to RegTech and SupTech. The paper makes a vital contribution to existing commentary by determining how a balance can be struck between “top-down” and “bottom-up” types of regulation (i.e. should regulation be entirely concerned with industry-driven standards, such as codes of conduct?). © 2022, Jonathan McCarthy.","Banking regulation; Finance; Financial law; Financial regulation; Financial services; Reporting","","","","","","","","Arner, Douglas W., FinTech, regTech, and the reconceptualization of financial regulation, Northwestern Journal of International Law and Business, 37, 3, pp. 373-415, (2017); Bamberger, Kenneth A., Technologies of compliance: Risk and regulation in a digital age, Texas Law Review, 88, 4, pp. 669-739, (2010); Future of Finance Review on the Outlook for the Uk Financial System, (2019); New Economy New Finance New Bank the Bank of England S Response to the Van Steenis Review on the Future of Finance, (2019); Transforming Data Collection from the Uk Financial Sector A Plan for 2021 and Beyond, (2021); Stan J Blockchain L Pol Y, (2021); Fsi Insights on Policy Implementation, (2021); Buckley, Ross P., Regulating Artificial Intelligence in Finance: Putting the Human in the Loop, Sydney Law Review, 43, 1, pp. 43-82, (2021); Buiten, Miriam C., Towards intelligent regulation of artificial intelligence, European Journal of Risk Regulation, 10, 1, pp. 41-59, (2019); Disrupting Finance Fintech and Strategy in the 21st Century, (2019)","J.

These discoveries have resulted in fines and settlements amounting to billions of US dollars, criminal proceedings and stricter regulation worldwide. However, recent legal cases and regulatory reports indicate that authorities have stepped up their efforts to crack down on so-called “cross-market spoofing”. The manipulative tactic involves a combination of a genuine order in one market and a spoof order in another, which is notoriously difficult to detect. In this paper, we use a high-frequency data set of limit order book snapshots from the foreign exchange (FX) spot market to develop and test a methodology to assess the feasibility, and hence potential prevalence, of cross-market spoofing. Our findings show that predictable reactions follow potential single-market spoofs that a market manipulator may exploit. Crucially, we also find that predictability may be observed in closely related markets. In particular, we discover that EUR/JPY offers a reliable pathway for a manipulator to exploit via spoof orders at deeper levels in the EUR/USD or USD/JPY limit order books. The findings suggest that a manipulator is more likely to submit a spoof order in a liquid market and a resting order in a less liquid but closely related market, rather than vice versa. Moreover, cross-market spoof orders are more likely to be found in markets that act as hedging markets. © 2023 The Author(s)","Foreign exchange; Limit order book; Manipulation; Market microstructure; RegTech; Spoofing; Trade surveillance","","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN; Meiji University; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science London, JSPS, (18H00873); Great Britain Sasakawa Foundation, (5940)","This paper was presented at the special-theme conference on The Effectiveness of Financial Regulation hosted by the Heth Academic Center for Research of Competition and Regulation and The School of Economics at the College of Management Academic Studies, Israel.

This condition shows that the fintech legal framework in Indonesia still needs to be entirely relevant to the concept of Regulatory Technology (regtech). This study aims to analyze the position of the fintech legal framework in Indonesia in overcoming illegal fintech with a regtech approach chosen as an analytical instrument—a basic concept that combines law and digital financial technology to create an orderly platform and comply with all applicable laws. This article uses normative-legal research methods and a conceptual approach, indicating that the legal framework governing fintech in Indonesia fragments, with rules spreading across the civil, administrative, and criminal sectors. This legal framework still needs to be reinforced as a legal tool to overcome the problem. Based on the regtech approach, increased transparency and accountability in fintech implementation are essential as legal support for dynamic supervision and law enforcement and to allow for wider access to cooperation between stakeholdersin handling illegal fintech. Such measures will help create a more effective legal environment and align with the regtech paradigm in addressing illegal fintech practices in Indonesia. © 2023, Maulana Malik Ibrahim State Islamic University of Malang.

This article critically examines the extent of alignment between regulatory technology (RegTech) and sanctions compliance requirements, using the nascent Australian sanctions regime as an illustrative example. Applying insights from regulatory theory, the article differentiates between regulatory rules and goals to facilitate a nuanced evaluation of the prospects of automating sanctions compliance. It also analyses the potential disconnects between RegTech and sanctions rules arising from flaws in an automated system's design, data inputs or underlying code, and mismatches between the capabilities of RegTech and the overarching regulatory goal of promoting a culture of compliance. The article argues that ongoing human interaction with well-calibrated RegTech tools is needed to promote alignment between RegTech and regulatory rules, and to meaningfully contribute to the broader culture of compliance goals. These insights have transferable relevance to diverse jurisdictions with complex sanctions compliance requirements and to other regulatory domains. © The Author/s 2023.","automation; compliance; RegTech; Sanctions regulation","","","","","","","","Anagnostopoulos, Yiannis, Fintech and regtech: Impact on regulators and banks, Journal of Economics and Business, 100, pp. 7-25, (2018); Arner, Douglas W., FinTech, regTech, and the reconceptualization of financial regulation, Northwestern Journal of International Law and Business, 37, 3, pp. 373-415, (2017); Research Foundation Briefs, (2017); Ashley, Kevin D., Artificial intelligence and legal analytics: New tools for law practice in the digital age, Artificial Intelligence and Legal Analytics: New Tools for Law Practice in the Digital Age, pp. 1-426, (2017); ABA Sanctions Guidelines A Guide to Industry Practice, (2021); Corporate Criminal Responsibility, (2020); ASIC S Innovation Hub and Our Approach to Regulatory Technology, (2017); Delaware Journal of Corporate Law, (2013); Bamberger, Kenneth A., Technologies of compliance: Risk and regulation in a digital age, Texas Law Review, 88, 4, pp. 669-739, (2010); California Law Review, (2016)","","","Queensland University of Technology","","","","","","","","","","English","Law.

Presently, as research and education on AML focus on financial institutions and authority, the individual is vulnerable to money laundering (ML) by being money mules with lack of awareness. Therefore, this paper illustrates the design of a 2-player simulation game for AML, which integrates the game-based learning model with plots including introduction stories, player actions and ending stories. In the game, a player role-plays either a money launderer or AML specialist. Within 6 in-game months, the former needs to perform ML with a target goal while the latter needs to identify the former's actions and restrict him to achieve his goal. For actions of the money launderer, this paper integrates the criminal order with the PLI model (placement, layering and integration) to simulate the full ML circle. The criminal order provides return to the attacker if he completes it within the time limit. Each layer in the PLI model is expanded with middle processes for the methodology. The attacker uses shell companies to hide his identity and support each transaction for ML with apparently legitimate reasons. For actions of the AML specialist, this paper integrates the AML transaction monitoring with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)'s Forty Recommendation. The defender needs to perform AML transaction monitoring with identifying suspicious financial activities based on money flow. Then, he needs to identify the actual beneficial owner of suspected companies with their share distributions. Both money flows and share distributions are visualized in data charts. Later, the defender shall report suspicious companies to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), which will return the investigation result at the beginning of the next in-game month. © 2023 Dechema e.V..

RegTech was originally introduced in the FinTech world. It assists organizations with monitoring, reporting and compliance practices. Since compliance is such a common need, RegTech has received attention for adoption by various industries. Technology adoption is neither easy nor a one-Time process. The adoption process requires stages and time until it reaches a high level of maturity. However, there is not any maturity model that can be referred to. In this research, a maturity model is developed to represent the RegTech adoption process in a company or organization. This model represents the maturity level of adoption into five levels: initial, proof of concept, build, expand, and improve. Each level is divided into five atrributes: Awareness & communication; policies, plans, and procedures; tools and automation; responsibility & accountability; as well as goal setting and measurement. Evaluation of the model is done by simulation. With this model, orgnization can measure their level of maturity in adopting RegTech, compare with other companies, and assist in determining a roadmap towards better RegTech implementation. Thus, this research is expected to provide a scientific contribution in modeling maturity level alternatives for the RegTech adoption process. © 2023 IEEE.","fintech; maturity model; measurement; regtech; technology adoption","Adoption process; Goal-setting; Maturity levels; Maturity model; Proof of concept; Regtech; Roadmap; Scientific contributions; Technology adoption; Technology implementation; Regulatory compliance","","","","","","","von Solms, Johan, Integrating Regulatory Technology (RegTech) into the digital transformation of a bank Treasury, Journal of Banking Regulation, 22, 2, pp. 152-168, (2021); Journal of Banking and Financial Technology, (2019); Northwestern Journal of International Law Business, (2016); Becker, Michael, RegTech—the application of modern information technology in regulatory affairs: areas of interest in research and practice, Intelligent Systems in Accounting, Finance and Management, 27, 4, pp. 161-167, (2020); Kristanto, Adhitya Dwi, Towards A Smart Regulatory Compliance, the Capabilities of RegTech and SupTech, 2022 International Conference on Information Technology Systems and Innovation, ICITSI 2022 - Proceedings, pp. 300-309, (2022); Dashottar, Surya, Corporate banking—risk management, regulatory and reporting framework in India: a Blockchain application-based approach, Journal of Banking Regulation, 22, 1, pp. 39-51, (2021); Anagnostopoulos, Yiannis, Fintech and regtech: Impact on regulators and banks, Journal of Economics and Business, 100, pp. 7-25, (2018); Journal of Financial Transformation, (2016); Turki, Meaad, The regulatory technology “RegTech” and money laundering prevention in Islamic and conventional banking industry, Heliyon, 6, 10, (2020); Du, Jingxiu, An analysis of regulatory technology in the Internet financial sector in conjunction with the logit model, Proceedings - 2020 2nd International Conference on Economic Management and Model Engineering, ICEMME 2020, pp. 428-431, (2020)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Bluebird; et al.; IndiHealth; Lintasarta; Sevima; Tower Bersama Group (TBG)","10th International Conference on ICT for Smart Society, ICISS 2023","2023-09-06 through 2023-09-07","Bandung","194000","","9798350339543","","","English","Int.

However，in practice，the rule conflicts such as “scope conflict” and “multi-track regulation” in the financial field may have a serious impact on blockchain applications. While increasing the compliance cost，such conflicts also diminish the effectiveness of the regulatory contract. To address these problems，the variable type dependency and propagation analysis methods are proposed based on the dependency graph to infer the potential types of variables in regulatory contracts and realize the symbolization of variables，statements，and rules according to the symbol types supported by Satisfiability Module Theories（SMT） solvers. A rule conflict detection method is proposed based on symbol analysis，which transforms the regulatory rule conflict problems into satisfiability problems and detects the self-conflict，complete conflict，and partial conflict problems.Moreover，a subset partitioning method is proposed to optimize the state space explosion in detecting complete conflicts among multiple regulatory rules.The experimental results show that the proposed methods can effectively detect various regulatory rule conflicts.When the conflict detection is performed on the regulatory rules with 300 lines of code，the average time of detecting self-conflict，complete conflict，and partial conflict is 1 234.9 ms，1 977.8 ms，and 2 364.5 ms，respectively. The time consumption is acceptable in practical applications and can provide a validity guarantee for the digitalization of regulatory rules. © 2023, Editorial Office of Computer Engineering.

Also, voices are being raised in favour of machine-consumable legislation and intelligent nudging, in order to increase legislative effectiveness, efficiency and transparency, thus enhancing compliance at a lower cost thanks to greater simplicity, lower error rate, clarity, accessibility and accountability. The traditional models of drafting and applying legislation were constructed to be used in a non-digital environment, especially because of the underlying hermeneutics process, although it may be interpreted and transformed in a more automatic and operational way in certain topics such as taxing or social security. Nevertheless, the cost required to understand and comply is often disproportionate comparing with the benefit of compliance. Therefore, there seems to be a language gap between production and consumption of legal rules. A (new) solution for this problem may lie in machine-consumable legislation, i.e. transforming legal text, concepts and rules (e.g. procedures, requirements and exemptions) into code that can be read, understood and interacted with by specific software. Also (legal) nudging can benefit from a more technological approach, by helping simplifying and making behaviour more automatic in the “right” direction. The digital world is already well aware of the power of nudging. It is time for the law and policy makers to grasp or at least look at similar instruments. The challenge to overcome the legal language and implementation disparity with technology in a digital era, which is still at an embryonic stage, despite its potential, presents several obstacles, from legal conservatism and a tendency towards inertia, to issues of legal certainty and the loss of humanism. Thus, this chapter intends, beyond a survey of the state of the art of rulemaking and nudging as code, to understand how it could work, its advantages and pitfalls, preferential areas of application, caution and limits in its implementation. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Accountability; Algorithmic law; Artificial intelligence; Better legislation; Data-driven law; Efficiency; Governance; Government-as-a-platform; Human rights; Innovation; Law in natural language; Legal interpretation; LegalTech, RegTech and SupTech; Machinable-consumable legislation; Nudging; Personalization; Rule-as-code; Separation of powers; Translation gap; Transparency","","","","","","","","Seven Principles for Digital Ready Legislation; Journal of Legal Education, (1978); Algorithmic Decision Systems Automation and Machine Learning in the Public Administration in the Cambridge Handbook of the Law of Algorithms, (2020); We Need to Recode the Rules of Government, (2020); Georgetown Journal of International Law, (2015); Fintech Regtech and the Reconceptualization of Financial Regulation Northw J Int Law Bus Forthcoming University of Hong Kong Faculty of Law Research Paper N 2016 035, (2016); Journal of Financial Transformation, (2016); Research Foundation Briefs, (2017); Guia De Legistica Para A Elaboracao De Actos Normativos, (2020); Ssrn Electronic Journal, (2018)","R.

Data for this study were collected through a structured survey questionnaire from 294 customers (only Fintech users) of different private banks in Bangladesh. The convenience sampling technique was used to select millennial customers. SPSS and SmartPLS software were used for data analysis. The results exhibited that EPS, Robo-advisory, and FS positively impact CE, while RTS was found insignificant with CE. Besides, customer trust (CT) mediates the relationships among EPSs, Robo-advisory, and FSs with CE. Conversely, CT does not mediate the RTS and CE relationship. The study findings contribute to the substantial pool of knowledge in Fintech services, CE, and consumer trust. Remarkably, the mediating role of CT between the Fintech services and CE relationship is the unique novelty of this study and will enrich the existing Fintech literature from Bangladesh’s perspective. © 2023 K.

Historically such credit rationales were written as a natural language document. This meant that automated handling of the meaning, i.e.: semantics, of such documents by machines was too complex to be done with sufficient accuracy. As a consequence, the creation and verification of a credit rationale is a time consuming and manual process. The solution that we propose is to create a Linked Data based credit rationale that we call the Advanced Credit Rationale (AdCR). Linked Data can ensure that the semantics in the credit rationale are both human and machine understandable. This enables the automated checking of the credit rationale for potential regulatory issues, as well as semantic based querying over a whole portfolio of such credit rationales. An issue that often hinders the use of a Linked Data based approach is that the creation of the knowledge graph can be challenging for domain experts. In this work we propose an approach that facilitates the creation of a credit rationale that is based on a Linked Data knowledge graph. We evaluate this approach with a prototype. We also demonstrate that with this approach the creation of a Linked Data based credit rationale should not take more time than a natural language based credit rationale. In addition we show that the structures that a Linked Data based credit rationale provides are generally seen as helpful. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Finance; FinTech; Knowledge Graph; Lending; Linked Data; RegTech","Data handling; Decision making; Linked data; Semantics; Automated handling; Decision-making process; Integral part; Knowledge graphs; Lending; Linked datum; Manual process; Natural languages; Regtech; Regulatory issues; Knowledge graph","","","","","","","Screening and Loan Origination Time Lending Standards Loan Defaults and Bank Failures; Bizer, Christian, Linked data: The story so far, Semantic Services, Interoperability and Web Applications: Emerging Concepts, pp. 205-227, (2011); Cornelli, Giulio, Fintech and big tech credit: Drivers of the growth of digital lending, Journal of Banking and Finance, 148, (2023); Davies, Stephen, User interface design considerations for Linked Data authoring environments, CEUR Workshop Proceedings, 628, (2010); Guidelines on Loan Origination and Monitoring, (2020); Management Information Systems Quarterly, (2008); Lohmann, Niels, Compliance by design for artifact-centric business processes, Information Systems, 38, 4, pp. 606-618, (2013); López, Vanessa, Evaluating question answering over linked data, Journal of Web Semantics, 21, pp. 3-13, (2013); Handbook on Ontologies, (2004); Peffers, Ken, A design science research methodology for information systems research, Journal of Management Information Systems, 24, 3, pp. 45-77, (2007)","N.

However, the high amount of regulatory texts makes it difficult for companies to identify which regulations apply to them. While regulatory technology, so-called RegTech, enables companies to comply with regulatory requirements or serves supervisory authorities to check compliance, there are no tools that enable companies to efficiently determine the relevance of a regulation in an automated manner. Therefore, this paper develops a decision support framework that makes use of techniques from natural language processing.

We consider the potential for blockchain technology to play a digital infrastructure role for corporate tax loss compliance in Australia: a “RegTech” solution. In doing so, we identify the key features of blockchain and key use cases across numerous business sectors, then examine the role and function of blockchain in the context of corporate tax losses, where complex carry forward rules (e.g. continuity of ownership, business continuity tests) apply to avoid the erosion of government revenues. We find that in theory, blockchain could enable key efficiencies in tax compliance of corporate tax losses; however, the complexity and discretion within tax law creates real barriers for an effective blockchain solution. We conclude that blockchain offers an ability to track and flag resource allocation to broad, high level elements of the corporate tax compliance. It therefore offers potential for the greater digital ecosystem; however, it does not offer a solution in isolation. As the world progresses towards increased digitalization, this use case highlights the need for continual reflection of complex regulations and high levels of discretion, whilst balancing taxpayer rights, equity and fairness.

Initially, the term “RegTech” referred to either the technical solutions intended to aid financial service providers in managing regulatory issues or to the companies and organizations that develop and deliver such solutions. Increasingly, regulatory experts are stretching the term’s coverage to include efforts by governments to harness technical solutions in pursuit of more efficient targeting and conduct of regulatory monitoring and enforcement. Whether deployed within the private or public sectors, RegTech holds significant potential to improve regulatory compliance, reduce compliance costs, and improve the speed and accuracy with which known harms can be addressed and emerging risks can be identified. Here, we focus on the potential for RegTech to support the creation of public value. We suggest public value is most likely to be realized when governments (1) keep focused on regulatory purpose and effective design and (2) build effective collaboration with RegTech providers and regulated entities. © 2023 The Author(s).

Recently, scholars have also started to explore the normative nature of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence systems. Most of this scholarship, however, adopts a largely theoretical perspective. This article takes a different approach and attempts to provide the discussion with a more factual grounding. It does so by investigating the construction of one particular Machine Learning system, the content moderation system Perspective API developed by Google. Its open-source development and a voluminous trove of publicly available documentation render Perspective API a virtually unique resource to study the inner logics of Machine Learning systems development. Based on an in-depth analysis of these logics, the article fleshes out similarities and dissimilarities concerning the normative structure of algorithmic and legal systems regarding four different subjects: practical constraints, evaluative diversity, modes of evolution and standards of evaluation. The article then relates the case of Perspective to the European Union’s proposal for an Artificial Intelligence Act and shows how the study’s insights might help in readying the Act for the realities of contemporary multi-party AI development. © 2023 The Author(s).

Further analysis shows that online shareholder voting makes the firms more attractive to mutual fund managers who are far away from the firms.

This paper contextualises and interrogates the novelty of the RegTech phenomenon as expounded in recent years by industry practitioners, regulators and a growing chorus of scholars. Harnessing the notion of ‘imaginary’ from Science and Technology Studies, we identify a particular solutionist vision materialising across public documents from national and international financial regulators, industry organisations, as well as RegTech and consulting firms. We identify two failures of an emerging RegTech imaginary. First, is a dynamism failure in the way RegTech materialises static visions of regulation. Second, is a systems failure as the solutionist RegTech imaginary focuses on narrower, individual problems in finance at the expense of wider changes occurring since the 2007–8 global financial crisis. RegTech, we conclude, reflects continuities with a pre-crisis era and fails to tackle key market and regulatory changes occurring since. Our analysis holds implications for the turn to technological solutions in addressing persistent issues of instability in global financial governance. We point to the need for developing wider imaginaries of technological possibilities for regulation in an increasingly digital world. © 2022 The Author(s).

To remedy this, we develop a novel regulatory scoring framework to quantify and compare the corresponding regulatory capital charge errors of credit scoring models. As an application of RegTech, the proposed framework considers the characteristic of example-dependence and cost-sensitivity in credit scoring, which is expected to enhance the ability of risk absorption of financial institutions and thus benefit the regulators. Validated on two real-world credit datasets, empirical results reveal that credit scoring models with good predictive accuracy or profitability do not necessarily provide low capital charge requirement error, which further highlights the importance of regulatory scoring framework. The family of gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) provides significantly better average performance than industry benchmarks and deep multilayer percep-tron network, especially when financial stability is the primary focus. To further examine the robustness of the proposed regulatory scoring, sampling techniques, cut-off value modification, and probability calibration are employed within the framework and the main conclusions hold in most cases. Furthermore, the analysis on the interpretability via TreeSHAP algorithm alleviates the concerns on transparency of GBDT-based models, and confirms the important roles of loan characteristics, borrowers’ solvency and creditworthiness as powerful predictors in credit scoring. Finally, the managerial implications for both financial institutions and regulators are discussed. © 2022 The Author(s).","credit scoring; financial regulation; gradient boosting decision tree; probability of default; RegTech; regulatory scoring","","","","","","(202110320012); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71874185, 72103082); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS, (15BTJ033); National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS; Major Project of Philosophy and Social Science Research in Colleges and Universities of Jiangsu Province, (2020SJA1018); Major Project of Philosophy and Social Science Research in Colleges and Universities of Jiangsu Province","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant [71874185, 72103082]; the Project of Philosophy and Social Science Research in Colleges and Universities in Jiangsu Province under Grant [2020SJA1018]; National Social Science Foundation of China under Grant [15BTJ033]; and National Training Program of Innovation and Entrepreneurship for Undergraduates [202110320012].; Funding text 2: We are grateful for the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71874185; 72103082), the Project of Philosophy and Social Science Research in Colleges and Universities in Jiangsu Province (2020SJA1018), National Social Science Foundation of China (15BTJ033), and National Training Program of Innovation and Entrepreneurship for Undergraduates (202110320012).

Criminal groups may become more interested in electronic payments and virtual currencies because of increased traffic in these areas. When comparing the second half of the 2019 to the first half of the 2020, the number of fraudulent card transactions increased by 11.4%. New developments in virtual currency trading regulations, including the digital finance package, which includes, among other things, a draught regulation from the European Parliament and an amended act to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, among others. For the reasons stated above, these regulations may lead to a virtual currency market collapse and the withdrawal of investors and the siphoning of money into Asian markets as a result. The current regulations are a manifestation of total regulation and do not encourage technological advancement. © 2022 Abhishek Thommandru et al., published by Sciendo.","AML; counteracting; CTF; FinTech; KNF (PFSA); MICA regulation; money laundering; RegTech","","","","","","","","Martin, Antoine, Endogenous multiple currencies, Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, 38, 1, pp. 245-262, (2006); Maurer, Bill, Data-mining for development?

Using a two-stage least squares instrumental variable regression approach and correcting for cross-sectional dependency, simultaneity, and endogeneity of regressors, the results establish a positive link between fintech and financial development. Our findings show that fintech supports financial sector development by enhancing access (loans), depth (deposits), and savings within China’s financial institutions. We also show that the emergence of fintech in the area of financial regulation (regulatory technology: regtech) can significantly improve financial development outcomes. Therefore, it is imperative for regulators to pursue policies that balance growth in the fintech sector while mitigating the associated risks. In addition, we use the difference-in-differences approach to show that policy measures such as interest rates liberalization also positively impacted financial development during the analysis period.

This paper aims to employ machine learning algorithms and artificial neural networks (ANN) to predict investment in Canada. Data for this study comes from cases heard by the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) between June 2008 and December 2019. In total, 406 cases were collected and coded for further analysis. After data cleaning and pre-processing, a total of 385 cases were coded for further analysis. The machine learning algorithms and artificial neural networks were able to predict investment fraud with very good results. In terms of standardized coefficient, the top five features in predicting fraud are offender experience, retired investors, the amount of money lost, the amount of money invested, and the investors' net worth. Machine learning and artificial intelligence have a pivotal role in regulation because they can identify the risks associated with fraud by learning from the data they ingest to survey past practices and come up with the best possible responses to predict fraud. If used correctly, machine learning in the form of regulatory technology can equip regulators with the tools to take corrective actions and make compliance more efficient to safeguard the markets and protect investors from unethical investment advisors. © © 2022 Lokanan.","artificial intelligence; investment fraud; machine learning; regulatory technology; self-regulation","","","","","","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC, (200775); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC","This study was funded by the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada.

This paper documents the real effects of RegTech in the market of corporate control. Exploiting the staggered implementation of the EDGAR system from 1993 to 1996 as quasi-exogenous RegTech shocks, we find that RegTech developments reduce firm acquisitiveness, especially for growth firms, solo-bidder deals, and stock-based acquisitions. Our main findings still hold when employing the stack-cohort approach to address concerns regarding biased staggered DiD estimators. In addition, EDGAR implementation discourages informed trading and lowers the acquirers' announcement returns. Overall, our deal-level analyses show how RegTech development matters for firm investment decisions with more granularities. Our paper differs from but complements recent empirical evidence that EDGAR implementation increases the level of overall investment, suggesting that dampened managerial learning induces firms to switch from highly risky and uncertain projects (M&As) to routine projects with less uncertainty (capital expenditures). © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","EDGAR; Firm acquisitiveness; Mergers and acquisitions (M&As); Price efficiency; Regulation technology (RegTech)","","","","","","(2072021122, 71802170, 72272126); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71988101, 72273115); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE; Xiamen University, XMU; Key Laboratory of Econometrics; Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education of China, (21YJC790038, 72102202); Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education of China","Funding text 1: We thank Zhiyao Chen, Vivian Fang, Itay Goldstein, Jiekun Huang, Yiming Qian, Yuan Ren, Terry Walter, Chi Zhang, Yinggang Zhou, and participants in 2022 Asian Finance Association Annual Meeting and seminars in Nankai University, Tianjin University, University of Massachusetts Lowell, University of Wollongong, and Xiamen University for their valuable comments.

This work builds on a systematic literature review and a bibliometric analysis of the literature on RegTech, its influential papers and authors, its main areas of research, its past and its future. The resulting multi-dimensional framework bridges across four main dimensions, starting with regulation and technology, where one or more regulations, not necessarily financial ones, are addressed with the support of technologies (e.g. artificial intelligence, DLT, blockchain, smart contracts, API). Data play a central role, as sharing them enables data ecosystems, where additional value can be attained by each market participant, while data automation and machine-readable regulations empower regulators to pull data directly from the banks’ systems and combine these data with data obtained directly from customers or other external sources. Several applications emerge, both for regulated entities, covering matters of compliance, monitoring, risk management, reporting and operations, as well as for authorities, which can leverage on RegTech (SupTech) solutions to make policies, to undertake their authorising, supervising and enforcement operations, for monitoring and controlling purposes, and even to issue fines automatically. As a consequence, stakeholders can reap a series of benefits, such as higher efficiency and effectiveness, accuracy, transparency and lower compliance costs but also risks, such as cyber risk, algorithmic biases, and dehumanization. © 2022, The Author(s).","Compliance; Data; Digital innovation; FinTech; Insurtech; Monitoring; RegTech; Regulation; Regulatory technology; Reporting; Risk management; SupTech","","","","","","Politecnico di Milano","Open access funding provided by Politecnico di Milano within the CRUI-CARE Agreement.

RegTech and SupTech, emerging from the ashes of the 2008 financial crisis, are not only helping to reduce the compliance burden and compliance time along with costs for financial institutions and supervisors but, more importantly, are fundamentally changing the nature of the financial services industry. This paper presents some key examples of the application of RegTech and SupTech. Data from nearly 40 regulators and expert sources in more than 20 developed, emerging and developing economies are analyzed, and two case studies are highlighted. These aspects were investigated using the following research methods: desk research and case study. The analysis provides an overview of the actual benefits of implementing these technologies. The paper tries to show the innovative changes RegTech and SupTech bring to different areas of financial supervision. Additionally, the study identifies the success factors of both industries and reviews the actual benefits of implementing these technologies. On this basis, their impact on financial supervision, the adaptation process of financial institutions, as well as the potential for the development of regulatory and supervisory technology in the future were analyzed. © Wydawnictwa Uniwersytetu Warszawskiego, Sekcja Wydawnicza Wydziału Zarzadzania Uniwersytetu Warszawskiego, Warszawa 2022.

Within this study, we propose design principles and features for a RegTech approach which provides automated assessments of financial consumer complaints. We follow three main design principles. First, we build upon information diagnosticity theory to address the need for explainable classifications empowering regulators to justify their actions. Second, we consider a bag-of-words representation and ensemble learning to ensure high classification accuracy. Third, we take into account author characteristics to avoid discriminating classifications. We evaluate our approach in the financial services industry and show its value for identifying consumer complaints resulting in monetary compensations.

In effect, if this technology is applied in the right way, it could be used to overcome the social and economic gaps that exist worldwide. Justification: However, until now, the specific legal regimes (RegTech) that have been established for Fintech have, in addition to the general lack of confidence in new technologies, made its implementation more difficult. Nevertheless, in order to consolidate Fintech, it is necessary to design suitable regulation to transform these new technologies into ordinary instruments of our financial system. Objective: Therefore, in order to promote an appropriate RegTech that allows for the progress of Fintech, it is necessary to analyse the legal problems that restrict their expansion by using an analytical methodology and a bibliographic compilation of legal resolutions. Main conclusion: Legal personal data protection is the main obstacle that must be overcome by paying attention to the guarantees inherent to this fundamental right. In this way, if the legal system is to be ready for the Digital Revolution, society must not be worried about either the loss of rights or increases in inequalities. ©","algorithmic transparency; big data; data protection; Fintech sustainability; RegTech","","","","","","","","Identifying Legal Ecological and Governance Obstacles and Opportunities for Adapting to Climate Change, (2014); Journal of Financial Transformation, (2017); Habemus Nuevo Reglamento General De Proteccion De Datos 2016 919 Actualidad Juridica Aranzadi; Greening of the Financial System and Fuelling A Sustainability Transition, (2018)","S.

Such analysis is used to analyze emerging technologies or predict the growing markets that influence the resulting social or economic development to assist in effective decision-making. Traditional trend analysis methods are time-consuming and require considerable labor. Moreover, the implemented processes may largely rely on the specific knowledge of the domain experts. With the advancement in the areas of science and technology, emerging cross-domain trends have received growing attention for its considerable influence on society and the economy. Consequently, emerging cross-domain predictions that combine or complement various technologies or integrate with diverse disciplines may be more critical than other tools and applications in the same domain. This study uses a design science research methodology, a text mining technique, and social network analysis (SNA) to analyze the development trends concerning the presentation of the product or service information on a company's website. This study applies regulatory technology (RegTech) as a case to analyze and justify the emerging cross-disciplinary trend. Furthermore, an experimental study is conducted using the Google search engine to verify and validate the proposed research mechanism at the end of this study. The study results reveal that, compared with Google Trends and Google Correlate, the research mechanism proposed in this study is more illustrative, feasible, and promising because it reduces noise and avoids the additional time and effort required to perform a further in-depth exploration to obtain the information. © 2021 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

To establish its effectiveness in meeting this obligation, we evaluate an ROPA semantic model, the Common Semantic Model–ROPA (CSM–ROPA). Semantic models and tools represent one solution to the compliance challenges faced by organisations: the heterogeneity of relevant data sources, and the lack of tool interoperability and agreed common standards. By surveying current practice and the literature we identify the requirements for GDPR accountability tools: digital exchange of data, automated accountability verification and privacy-aware data governance. A case study was conducted to analyse the expressivity and effectiveness of CSM–ROPA when used as an interoperable, machine-readable mediation layer to express the concepts in a comprehensive regulator-provided accountability framework used for GDPR compliance. We demonstrate that CSM–ROPA can express 98% of ROPA accountability terms and fully express nine of the ten European regulators' ROPA templates. We identify three terms for addition to CSM–ROPA, and we identify areas where CSM–ROPA relies on partial matches that indicate model limitations. These improvements to CSM–ROPA will provide comprehensive coverage of the regulator-supplied model.

To meet these obligations, these banks are increasingly relying on regulatory compliance technologies, also known as”regtech”. The use of AI technologies enhances the ability of regtech to perform complex tasks such as rating customer risk and identifying potential suspicious transactions. With the adoption of new risk assessment and risk mitigation standards for proliferation financing (PF) of weapons of mass destruction, there is a greater need for appropriate and improved regtech. This paper provides an overview of the development of these standards, their relationship with AML/CFT standards, and the common areas where regtech can be applied to meet AML/CFT obligations. It also highlights some of the legal risks associated with relying on regtech in this space. Regulators, compliance officers, and technologists must navigate these risks to ensure that appropriately-designed regtech can be used to increase global financial integrity and security. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

However, there are several insect pests that are responsible for the deterioration of stored grains thereby reducing their both market as well as nutritional value. Over the years hermetic technology has been largely encouraged for long storage as it ensures the protection without use of chemicals. The quick detection of infestation and timely management can be done through the refined and promising techniques such as sensing, pheromones, and visual lures. Sensing an automated monitoring technology ensures the prediction of contamination and classification of grains. The use of rapid assimilated machine vision software fitted with X-ray imaging detects both interior and exterior insects, conscious, and lifeless inside the grains. Ultraviolet and green light are the most attractive wavelengths to storage pests that lead to increased catch in traps. The classification of unbitten weevil grubs and those nibbled by wasps in wheat is ensured through near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Electronic nose technology distinguishes between grains inhabited by phytotoxic and non-phytotoxic species which in turn facilitates improving existing management of grain stores. The utilization of ionizing radiations to cause death of storage insects such as rusty grain beetles is an encouraging novelty as it is effective against all stages of insects and is non-residual in nature. The usage of natural control means such as predators and parasitoids is a good replacement to chemical insecticides but needs authentication as substitute. The computer-based modeling to foresee population growth of insects can remodel the IMP approaches for management of stored pests. This chapter highlights the advanced post-harvest innovative storage technologies to manage the deterioration and losses caused by the insect-pests to stored grains. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.","Hermetic technology; Insect pests; Monitoring technology; Regulatory technology; Stored grains","","","","","","","","Stored Grain Ecosystems, (1995); Bhattacharyya, Atanu, Nano-particles - A recent approach to insect pest control, African Journal of Biotechnology, 9, 24, pp. 3489-3493, (2010); Annual Review of Entomology, (1985); Burks, Charles S., Measuring fig quality using near-infrared spectroscopy, Journal of Stored Products Research, 36, 3, pp. 289-296, (2000); El-Naggar, Mehrez E., Soil application of nano silica on maize yield and its insecticidal activity against some stored insects after the post-harvest, Nanomaterials, 10, 4, (2020); Integrated Management of Insects in Stored Products, (1996); Flinn, P.

RegTech helps them to streamline compliance processes. Although dominant in the financial sector, ideally, RegTech can be implemented in various sectors other than finance. The critical elements of RegTech are regulated entities, supervisors and/or regulators, regulatory data, and data generated by regulated entities' activities. The technology at RegTech will bring all these elements together to achieve regulatory compliance. This study describes RegTech regarding technology utilization, characteristics, and architecture in the financial industry. The results of this study can be adopted as a basis for answering the challenges of implementing RegTech in various sectors of activity. Therefore, we used the systematic literature review approach to review several prior studies. Based on the search results, thirty-seven articles were chosen successfully for further review. RegTech focussed on four characteristics: Agility, speed, integration, and analytics. Various technologies are used in RegTech, such as big data analytics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, cloud computing, blockchain, etc. Generally, RegTech architecture components can be grouped into enterprise architecture (EA) layers: business, data, application, and technology. © 2022 IEEE.","architectures; characteristics; regtech; systematic literature review; technologies","Artificial intelligence; Cloud analytics; Computer architecture; Data Analytics; Engineering education; Regulatory compliance; Characteristic; Digital innovations; Financial sectors; Financial services industries; Information technology innovation; Regtech; Systematic literature review; Technology; Technology architectures; Technology characteristics; Finance","","","","","","","Barrell, Ray J., Financial regulation, National Institute Economic Review, 216, 1, pp. F4-F9, (2011); Research Foundation Briefs, (2017); Butler, Tom, Understanding RegTech for Digital Regulatory Compliance, Palgrave Studies in Digital Business and Enabling Technologies, pp. 85-102, (2019); Micheler, Eva, Regulatory Technology: Replacing Law with Computer Code, European Business Organization Law Review, 21, 2, pp. 349-377, (2020); Wymeersch, Eddy, The structure of financial supervision in europe: About single financial supervisors, twin peaks and multiple financial supervisors, European Business Organization Law Review, 8, 2, pp. 237-306, (2007); J Bank Regul, (2020); Gozman, Daniel P., A case study of using blockchain technology in regulatory technology, MIS Quarterly Executive, 19, 1, pp. 19-37, (2020); Regtech Building A Better Financial System, (2017); Du, Jingxiu, An analysis of regulatory technology in the Internet financial sector in conjunction with the logit model, Proceedings - 2020 2nd International Conference on Economic Management and Model Engineering, ICEMME 2020, pp. 428-431, (2020); Emergence of Regtech 2 0 from Know Your Customer to Know Your Data Hal, (2017)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Indonesia Section","7th International Conference on Information Technology Systems and Innovation, ICITSI 2022","2022-11-08 through 2022-11-09","Bandung","185065","","9781665465557","","","English","Int.

Financial institutions needed to interpret new regulations and swiftly adjusted to them. RegTech, Regulatory Technology, was born to ease the regulatory requirements compliance process. RegTech was then also adopted by supervisor and/or regulator to supervise the compliance of financial institutions. The adoption of RegTech by supervisor is called SupTech (Supervisory Technology). RegTech and SupTech were discussed mostly in banking or financial research. This paper tries to bring more nuance to information technology e.g., the capabilities and their underpinning technology. Hence, RegTech/SupTech can be more discussed in computer science research. This paper also concludes the definition of RegTech/Suptech and states one core capability of RegTech with its four pillars. © 2022 IEEE.","RegTech; Smart Regulatory Compliance; SupTech","Finance; Supervisory personnel; Computer science research; Core capabilities; Financial institution; Financial regulations; Global financial crisis; Regtech; Regulatory requirements; Smart regulatory compliance; Supervisory technology; Regulatory compliance","","","","","","","von Solms, Johan, Integrating Regulatory Technology (RegTech) into the digital transformation of a bank Treasury, Journal of Banking Regulation, 22, 2, pp. 152-168, (2021); Dashottar, Surya, Corporate banking—risk management, regulatory and reporting framework in India: a Blockchain application-based approach, Journal of Banking Regulation, 22, 1, pp. 39-51, (2021); Anagnostopoulos, Yiannis, Fintech and regtech: Impact on regulators and banks, Journal of Economics and Business, 100, pp. 7-25, (2018); Financial Authorities in the Era of Data Abundance Regtech Regulators and Suptech Solutions, (2018); Barykin, Sergey Evgenievich, The logistics approach to perspectives for the digital technologies in Russia, IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering, 918, 1, (2020); Northwestern Journal of International Law Business, (2016); Journal of Financial Transformation, (2016); Turki, Meaad, The regulatory technology “RegTech” and money laundering prevention in Islamic and conventional banking industry, Heliyon, 6, 10, (2020); Du, Jingxiu, An analysis of regulatory technology in the Internet financial sector in conjunction with the logit model, Proceedings - 2020 2nd International Conference on Economic Management and Model Engineering, ICEMME 2020, pp. 428-431, (2020); Supervisory Technology Suptech, (2020)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Indonesia Section","7th International Conference on Information Technology Systems and Innovation, ICITSI 2022","2022-11-08 through 2022-11-09","Bandung","185065","","9781665465557","","","English","Int.

Aiming at the above problems, this paper studies the trusted supervision technology scheme suitable for blockchain data privacy protection, enriches and expands on the classic BIP32 protocol, and designs and implements a dynamic authorization strategy in the new protocol. Authorization policies make private data truly in the hands of users by changing and setting regulatory permissions. The experimental results and performance comparison show that the blockchain data privacy protection method proposed by this scheme is efficient, stable, and has strong practicability, which is suitable for data privacy protection scenarios of trusted supervision. At the same time, experiments show that with the increase of the encryption key depth, the supervision time increases linearly. © 2022 SPIE.","Authorization Control; Blockchain; Privacy Protection; Trusted Supervision","Authorization; Cryptography; Data privacy; Authorization controls; Authorization policy; Block-chain; Data privacy protections; Design and implements; New protocol; Privacy protection; Private data; Trusted supervision; User data; Blockchain","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","Funding text 1: The paper is supported by the joint fund for enterprise innovation and development of National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.U19B2021).; Funding text 2: The paper is supported by the joint fund for enterprise innovation and Foundation of China (No.U19B2021).","Cryptography Mailing List, (2009); Bruegel Policy Contribution, (2018); Weiss, Martin B.H., On the application of blockchains to spectrum management, IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking, 5, 2, pp. 193-205, (2019); Saad, Muhammad, Exploring the Attack Surface of Blockchain: A Comprehensive Survey, IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials, 22, 3, pp. 1977-2008, (2020); Wu, Yulei, Convergence of Blockchain and Edge Computing for Secure and Scalable IIoT Critical Infrastructures in Industry 4.0, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 8, 4, pp. 2300-2317, (2021); Xu, Hao, Blockchain-enabled resource management and sharing for 6G communications, Digital Communications and Networks, 6, 3, pp. 261-269, (2020); Liang, Ying Chang, Blockchain for dynamic spectrum management, Signals and Communication Technology, pp. 121-146, (2020); IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, (2021); Dwork, Cynthia, Differential privacy: A survey of results, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 4978 LNCS, pp. 1-19, (2008); ACM Stoc, (2009)","Z.

Findings from our review show that the practitioner-oriented literature foreshadowed the rise of FinTech by extensively reporting on algorithm-based and electronic trading (2009 onwards), followed by reporting on FinTech start-ups and funding successes (2014 onwards). The practitioner literature subsequently reported on alternative finance models, the introduction of cryptocurrencies, and risks and regulatory issues. Academic literature on FinTech began to rise from 2014 onwards, focusing initially on the development of FinTech in the aftermath of the 2007-2008 global financial crisis. Research attention subsequently shifted to FinTech innovations (alternative finance, cryptocurrency and blockchain, machine-based methods for financial analysis and forecasting, including artificial intelligence), as well as risk and regulatory issues. IS work on FinTech started to emerge from 2015 onwards, initially focusing on mobile payment systems and peer-to-peer lending. However, the body of work at the intersection of FinTech and IS is still small. Our review sheds light on several opportunities for future research, including financial inclusion, the impacts arising from COVID-19, and the emergence of new business models, such as Banking as a Service (BaaS). © 2022 by the Association for Information Systems.","AlgoTrading; Banking as a Service (BaaS); COVID-19; Cryptocurrency; Financial Inclusion; Literature Review; Machine-based Learning; RegTech; Research Trends; Risk and Regulation","Electronic money; Finance; Information systems; Information use; Machine learning; Peer to peer networks; Risk assessment; Algotrading; Banking as a service (baa); Financial inclusions; Literature reviews; Machine-based learning; Regtech; Regulatory issues; Research trends; Risk and regulation; Risk issues; COVID-19","","","","","Australian Research Council, ARC, (LP200301118); Australian Research Council, ARC","Martina Linnenluecke is Professor of Environmental Finance and leads the Center for Corporate Sustainability and Environmental Finance at Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia.

Specifically, financial sector aims to efficiently supply distinct services using an infrastructure by relying on a centralised authority to manage and coordinate transactions at specific prices. In turn, final customers constantly seek to lower costs, quality, and reliability. Moreover, costumers desire less documentation and bureaucracy which hinder the access to financial services and credits. Financial system needs to create a digital strategy at the organisational level to address technology challenges and satisfy user’s needs. In this scenario, financial and technology domains have been integrated originating FinTech business models with significant impact. Therefore, this paper contributes not only with a technology background which allow to explore new FinTech-based business models but also describing existing business models employed in the market. Moreover, we present a comparison among traditional and FinTech-based models allowing to analyse the financial progress.

It is also one of the most researched topics during the current period. Banks and financial institutions nowadays are collecting large amounts of customer information which are imposed with AI and machine learning; however, the succeeding of all information remains unknown. This study attempts to identify the ethical issues in the application of Artificial intelligence and offers remedies from the Shariah principles. It also examines the role of Regulation technology (RegTech) in Islamic financial institutions. This study is exploratory in nature and used mainly primary data for the analysis purpose. The primary data is collected through the structured questionnaire obtained from the sharia scholars living in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. The findings of the study suggest that the there is a significant relationship between ethical issues in AI implementation, role of RegTech and Islamic finance. The findings also suggest that the effective and intelligent utilization of RegTech and Islamic finance tools can reduce the ethical concern related to the AI implementation. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial intelligence; Ethical issues; Ethics; Islamic finance","","","","","","","","Qadir, Junaid, Teaching Ethics, (Islamic) Values and Technology: Musings on Course Design and Experience, Proceedings of the 2018 7th International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering, ICCCE 2018, pp. 486-491, (2018); Rabbani, Mustafa Raza, The competitive structure and strategic positioning of commercial banks in Saudi Arabia, International Journal on Emerging Technologies, 11, 3, pp. 43-46, (2020); Icr Journal, (2019); Int J Electron Bank, (2020); undefined; Iium Engineering Journal, (2012); 10 Examples of Artificial Intelligence Youre Using in Daily Life, (2018); Customer Needs and Solutions, (2018); Yampolskiy, Roman V., Taxonomy of pathways to dangerous artificial intelligence, AAAI Workshop - Technical Report, WS-16-01 - WS-16-15, pp. 143-148, (2016); Baum, Seth D., Social choice ethics in artificial intelligence, AI and Society, 35, 1, pp. 165-176, (2020)","A.

Roughly one trillion $ market value in less than thirty minutes vanished with the biggest one-day point decline in the history of the DJIA at the time. Since the market events took place in electronic markets, and algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading, parts of FinTech, played significant roles, we handle the May 6 flash crash from the FinTech, SupTech, and financial supervision perspectives. With the flashback method, we analyzed the reactions of market participants, media, and two financial supervisors, the SEC, and the CFTC, to the market crash. We find that the technological imbalance between financial markets or institutions and their supervisors drove the markets in uncertainty, hence in a fear and panic environment. Since the imbalance has not diminished yet, the same risks still exist.

Fintech covers an enormous range of activities from data security to financial service deliverables that enable the companies to automate their existing business structure and introduce innovative products and services. Therefore, there is an increasing demand for scholars and professionals to identify the future trends and directions of the topic. This is why the present study conducted a bibliometric analysis in social, environmental, and computer sciences fields to analyse the implementation of environment-friendly computer applications to benefit societal growth and well-being. We have used the ‘bibliometrix 3.0’ package of the r-program to analyse the core aspects of fintech systematically. The study suggests that ‘ACM International Conference Proceedings’ is the core source of published fintech literature. China leads in both multiple and single country production of fintech publications. Bina Nusantara University is the most relevant affiliation. Arner and Buckley provide impactful fintech literature. In the conceptual framework, we analyse relationships between different topics of fintech and address dynamic research streams and themes. These research streams and themes highlight the future directions and core topics of fintech. The study deploys a co-occurrence network to differentiate the entire fintech literature into three research streams. These research streams are related to ‘cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, financial technology’, ‘financial industry stability, service, innovation, regulatory technology (regtech)’, and ‘machine learning and deep learning innovations’. The study deploys a thematic map to identify basic, emerging, dropping, isolated, and motor themes based on centrality and density. These various themes and streams are designed to lead the researchers, academicians, policymakers, and practitioners to narrow, distinctive, and significant topics. © 2021 by the authors.

This has put increasing pressure on banks to monitor and report a range of intricate exposures to comply with new prudential requirements. Regulatory Technology (RegTech) is an emerging technology trend leveraging Information Technology and Digital Innovations that can greatly assist with a bank’s regulatory management process. A consideration is that these technologies can sometimes be expensive and inefficient if deployed on an ad hoc and stand-alone basis. An option is to incorporate RegTech into the digital transformation strategy of a management function such as Treasury. Integrated adoption would mean the digital platform can be deployed to support both strategic management activities and enhanced regulatory processes within Treasury, thereby ensuring commercial and prudential objectives are aligned. RegTech can provide an invaluable tool, in a business-as-usual environment, as well as in real-life stress events, such as the recent Coronavirus outbreak.

This article explores an approach to applying Regtech techniques to antitrust enforcement. It does this by applying those techniques to the detection of resale price maintenance (vertical price fixing). The exploration is limited to pricing on e-commerce platforms such as AliExpress, eBay, and Amazon Marketplace. The Regtech application is effected by presenting the literature and cases on resale price maintenance and the application of the law in Australia, the US, and the EU. The article examines the application of machine learning in the Regtech environment and the ways in which application programming interfaces could be used. The article proposes approaches to machine learning solutions for the detection of potentially infringing resale price maintenance conduct.

Despite multiple initiatives and regulatory changes, there is a need to revisit the reporting and regulatory frameworks and redefine the focus areas. Banks credit problem has often been explored under the lens of asymmetric information. Spreads are generally directly proportional to probability of default and an inverse function of collateral and security. However, in India, there is a noticeable gap in academic literature to suggest robust institutional reforms to address the twin curse of adverse selection and moral hazard. Regulatory frameworks, particularly with respect to risk management function of banks, also grapple with predicting forthcoming disruptions. As banks redesign their corporate customer experience on a digitalized scale, leveraging large-scale available data, there is a bigger challenge to the regulator to ensure risk regulations are effective and save costs as well. The authors suggest that if information asymmetry exists, the blockchain protocols may mitigate uncertainty. Though blockchain technology has been leveraged to increase effectiveness of certain corporate banking products, the originality of the paper lies in coming out with a detailed framework for the possible use of blockchain (a distributed ledger based technology) for credit decisions, timely generation of red-flags and tightening the regulatory framework. The paper also lists down suggestions to improve the enabling regulatory and reporting architecture using regulatory technology (RegTech) to support unification of data already available in the banking system. This will improve the quality of information available to the lenders and enable them to take more informed credit decisions (data-driven finance), while granting and monitoring loans. Ultimately, it will lead to an optimization of credit risk capital. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.","Bank regulations; Blockchain; Corporate banking; Distributed ledger technology; FinTech; Information asymmetry; Non-performing assets; RegTech; Reporting framework","","","","","","","","Economic Implications of Blockchain Platforms, (2019); Casino, Fran, A systematic literature review of blockchain-based applications: Current status, classification and open issues, Telematics and Informatics, 36, pp. 55-81, (2019); Farrell, L.

The Global Legal Entity Identifier System (GLEIS), was developed to enable financial regulators to trace the owners of financial assets and liabilities, which was revealed as a problem by the global financial crisis of 2008. This chapter focuses on one of the key controversies that arose as part of the development of GLEIS-the issue of data quality. The chapter uses the GLEIS case to explain how differing views among infrastructure participants about the development of a complex data-driven regulatory system are reconciled. It shows that establishing such a system involves the turning of publicly available data into valuable assets in a process the chapter calls ‘capitalization through certification’ and argue that this process is relevant to broader debates about the use of business intelligence and analytics tools and techniques for regulatory purposes. © Oxford University Press 2021.","Big data; Data capitalization; Data quality; Financial regulation; Identification infrastructures; Regtech","","","","","","","","Abbasi, Ahmed Ali, Big data research in information systems: Toward an inclusive research agenda, Journal of the Association for Information Systems, 17, 2, pp. 1-32, (2016); Agarwal, Ritu, Big data, data science, and analytics: The opportunity and challenge for IS research, Information Systems Research, 25, 3, pp. 443-448, (2014); Economic Journal, (1989); Beynon-Davies, Paul, Form-ing institutional order: The scaffolding of lists and identifiers, Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology, 67, 11, pp. 2738-2753, (2016); Callon, Michel, Some elements of a sociology of translation: Domestication of the scallops and the fishermen of St Brieuc Bay, Sociological Review, 32, S1, pp. 196-233, (1984); Social Construction of Technological Systems, (1987); Cantarelli, Chantal C., Lock-in and its influence on the project performance of large-scale transportation infrastructure projects: Investigating the way in which lock-in can emerge and affect cost overruns, Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design, 37, 5, pp. 792-807, (2010); Ciborra, Claudio U., From tool to Gestell:Agendas for managing the information infrastructure, Information Technology & People, 11, 4, pp. 305-327, (1998); Clarke, Roger A., Human Identification in Information Systems: Management Challenges and Public Policy Issues, Information Technology & People, 7, 4, pp. 6-37, (1994); Correspondent Banking Consultative Report Bank for International Settlements, (2015)","","","Oxford University Press","","","","","","","9780198854722","","","English","Combating Fiscal Fraud and Empower.

Having reviewed the market conditions and the reasons why AI is well suited to be used for legal risk and regulatory use cases, this chapter highlights potential solutions in these fields. The increase in the amounts of fines is directly correlated to a significant increase in the amount of regulatory changes per year, at least during the post-financial crisis period. At a high level, RegTech and legal risk solutions typically fall into the following five main categories: general compliance/legal processes, monitoring, risk, legal/regulatory analysis, and reporting. Therefore, from an AI perspective the monitoring and legal/regulatory analysis are the most relevant fields, while general compliance/legal is an automation game. © 2020 FINTECH Circle Ltd.","artificial intelligence; financial crisis; legal regulation; legal risk; RegTech","","","","","","","","","","","wiley","","","","","","","9781119551904; 9781119551966","","","English","The AI Book: The Artificial Intelligence Handbook for Investors, Entrepreneurs and FinTech Visionaries","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160186381"

This chapter looks at three key areas: the evolution of RegTech (Journey from RegTech 1.0 to 3.0), phases of RegTech tools, and future of RegTech. RegTech 1.0 was mostly driven by large financial institutions who integrated technology into their internal processes to combat rising compliance costs and complexity as epitomized in the Basel II capital accord. While RegTech 1.0 to 2.0 focused on cost gains and efficiency, 3.0 is shifting focus towards reconceptualizing the financial and regulatory landscape, for example, by shifting the focus from a KYC to a KYD (know your data) mindset. The RegTech 3.0 has four phases of development: manual, workflow automation, continuous monitoring, and predictive analytics. © 2020 FINTECH Circle Ltd.","continuous monitoring; financial institutions; manual development; predictive analytics; RegTech; workflow automation","","","","","","","","","","","wiley","","","","","","","9781119551904; 9781119551966","","","English","The AI Book: The Artificial Intelligence Handbook for Investors, Entrepreneurs and FinTech Visionaries","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160173365"

First, a brief analysis is made of the importance of the topic and the risks of the lack of good regulation. Subsequently, different cases of regulation are analyzed at the level of the traditional financial sector, as well as of some States that are considered decisive for the Fintech business, including Colombia, which has shown a good development of such ventures at the regional level. To achieve the task that we set ourselves, the deductive method was used, starting from the generality of the available information, and subsequently to an analysis of specific cases. Regarding the case study, it was a comparative study to offer a broader view of what should be the best applicable regulation. After this analysis, it was concluded that currently no state model would serve as an international model law and that what is required is a dialogue between States and businessmen to be able to approach the issue from different perspectives, in such a way that ensure economic growth and protection of both the economy and consumers internationally © The author; licensee Universidad de la Costa - CUC","financial system; Fintech; international regulation; policy-makers; Regtech","","","","","","","","Research Foundation Briefs, (2017); Arner, Douglas W., RegTech: Building a Better Financial System, Handbook of Blockchain, Digital Finance, and Inclusion, Volume 1: Cryptocurrency, FinTech, InsurTech, and Regulation, pp. 359-373, (2017); Practicas Globales De Regulacion Y Supervision De Fintech Regulacion Para La Innovacion Responsable Y Competitiva Del Sector Financiero, (2019); Basel III International Regulatory Framework for Banks, (2017); Boehmer, Ekkehart, Bank privatization in developing and developed countries: Cross-sectional evidence on the impact of economic and political factors, Journal of Banking and Finance, 29, 8-9 SPEC.

The intensity of globalization processes leads to the economic integration of the economies and financial sectors of the countries of the world. The main trend of the modern financial sector is the accelerated introduction of technological innovations, innovative financial services and tools for their implementation. The use of digital technologies helps to reduce the cost of maintenance and operational risks. Creating a digital basis for serving consumers by finance companies increases their productivity and spurs more innovation in the financial arena. This, in turn, maintains the soundness of the financial sector. Restyling of financial services is based on the use of artificial intelligence and cloud technologies by financial companies, which allows to meet the needs and expectations of consumers. The use of tools for digital transformation of the financial sector provides maximum personalization, while using a large variety of parameters. Tracking and comparing changes in regulatory documents using RegTech and NLP provides an important area of activity for financial companies - compliance. An inevitable process is the virtualization of information interaction between financial sector entities based on the use of cloud technologies. However, the imperfection of these technologies at the moment does not allow them to be fully used. Therefore, in order to create favorable conditions for the introduction of innovations in the financial sector based on cloud technologies, it is necessary to implement a number of actions proposed in the article. The studies carried out allow us to assert that due to digital transformations of the financial sector, the efficiency of business processes increases and powerful advantages of its subjects are formed. But at the same time, there are some restrictions on their full implementation and risks on the way to the development of the digital financial sector in Ukraine. The proposed potential means of accelerated digitalization of the financial sector of the economy are in the large-scale and all-encompassing use of cloud technologies and artificial intelligence. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors","artificial intelligence; cloud technologies; digitalization; financial innovation; financial sector; ICT; RegTech; restyling","Artificial intelligence; Economics; Regulatory compliance; Cloud technologies; Digitalization; Financial companies; Financial innovation; Financial sectors; Financial service; ICT; Regtech; Restyling; Ukraine; Finance","","","","","National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, NASU","This study was conducted at the Department of Finance, Banking and Insurance of Odessa I.I.

We evaluate a semantic model CSM-ROPA to establish the extent to which it can be used to express a regulator provided accountability tracker to facilitate GDPR/ROPA compliance. We show that the ROPA practices of organisations are largely based on manual paper-based templates or non-interoperable systems, leading to inadequate GDPR/ROPA compliance levels. We contrast these current approaches to GDPR/ROPA compliance with best practice for regulatory compliance and identify four critical features of systems to support accountability. We conduct a case study to analyse the extent that CSM-ROPA, can be used as an interoperable, machine-readable mediation layer to express a regulator supplied ROPA accountability tracker. We demonstrate that CSM-ROPA can successfully express 92% of ROPA accountability terms. The addition of connectable vocabularies brings the expressivity to 98%.

Through the convenience of social media platforms as a means of communication, content sharing and even payment between different users, black market transactions are now enabled by e-commerce. Tax authorities worldwide have voiced their concern over the difficulty to detect such transactions over the internet. This paper presents a machine learning based Regtech tool for international tax authorities to detect transaction-based tax evasion activities across social e-commerce. To build such a tool, we collected a dataset of 58, 660 Instagram posts and manually labelled 2, 041 sampled posts with multiple properties related to transaction-based tax evasion activities. Based on the dataset, we developed a multimodal deep neural network to automatically detect suspicious posts. The proposed model combines comments, hashtags and image modalities (including extracted from videos) to produce the final output. As shown by our experiments, the complementary combined model achieved sensitivity of 71.9 %, specificity of 87.5%, accuracy of 84.1 % and AUC of 0.837, outperforming any single modality models. This tool could help tax authorities to identify audit targets in an efficient and effective manner, and combat social e-commerce tax evasion in scale. © 2021 IEEE.","Deep neural networks; Regtech; Social e-commerce; Social media; Tax administration","Electronic commerce; Social networking (online); Taxation; Communications content; Content Sharing; E- commerces; Multi-modal; Regtech; Social e-commerce; Social media; Social media platforms; Tax authorities; Tax evasions; Deep neural networks","","","","","","","Strategies and Activities to Address the Cash and Hidden Economy, (2016); National Tax Journal, (1985); Thailand to Launch Value Added Tax in 2020, (2019); Digital Archipelago how Online Commerce is Driving Indonesias Economic Development, (2018); Gasparėnienė, Ligita, Concept, motives and channels of digital shadow economy: consumers’ attitude, Journal of Business Economics and Management, 18, 2, pp. 273-287, (2017); Chinese Grey Market A 1 Billion Tax Black Hole the Network of Chinese Personal Shoppers Known as Daigou have Been Quietly Operating A Grey Market for Years but do They Pay Tax, (2016); Agrawal, Sweta, Deep learning for detecting cyberbullying across multiple social media platforms, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 10772 LNCS, pp. 141-153, (2018); Cheung, Pak Ming, Deep learning-based online counterfeit-seller detection, INFOCOM 2018 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops, pp. 51-56, (2018); Hassanpour, Saeed, Identifying substance use risk based on deep neural networks and Instagram social media data, Neuropsychopharmacology, 44, 3, pp. 487-494, (2019); Li, Jiawei, A machine learning approach for the detection and characterization of illicit drug dealers on instagram: Model evaluation study, Journal of Medical Internet Research, 21, 6, (2019)","","Zhou, J.; Salvado, O.; Sohel, F.; Borges, P.V.K.; Wang, S.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","AI4Space; Defence Science and Technology (DST) Group; Destination Gold Coast; et al.; MathWorks; SmartSat CRC","2021 International Conference on Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications, DICTA 2021","2021-11-29 through 2021-12-01","Gold Coast","175863","","9781665417099","","","English","DICTA - Int.

These changes are detected by the proposed warning system that not only monitors changes in normative acts, but also gives an opportunity to analyse organizational data with the purpose of identifying performance of which legal entities could be negatively impacted by the changes in regulations and, thus, which entities are to be warned regarding the estimated consequences of regulatory changes. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Compliance; Document graphs; Normative document analysis; Performance analytics; RegTech; Warning system","Artificial intelligence; Compliance; Document graph; Documents analysis; Normative document analyse; Normative documents; Organisational; Performance; Performance analytic; Regtech; Research topics; Laws and legislation","","","","","European Commission, EC, (1.19, 1.2.1.1/18/A/003)","Acknowledgments.

Such changes are due, in particular, to the concentration and scaling up and diversification of the structure of financial services, the renewal of the financial sector on the basis of FinTech operations and blockchain technologies. This requires taking into account the impact of innovation factors on the transformation of the financial market in the dimension of FinTech. The study aims to identify the imperatives of global financial innovation and show ways to develop innovative models in the interpretation of S-curves for next-generation products using new technologies when key technologies on the previous S-curve become obsolete. Also, the matrix of financial innovations is presented and the synergy of its innovation models is proved. The results of the study are to prove that each of the presented models is not independent, it evolves and develops itself, as well as affects other models. This made it possible to identify prognostic pathways for the development of innovative models in their synergy in the form of two-ring motion. Thus, the study emphasizes the need for further research aimed at developing innovative models that will determine strategic decisions in the formation of innovation imperatives. © 2021 LLC CPC Business Perspectives.

The study tried to address the general concept of electronic Signatures and the essential legal laws that regulate its application. Based on the analysis of the reality of the electronic Signature’s uses and applications in Palestine, the researcher found that it is not applied at all in all banking and non-banking financial sectors. It is only adopted at the Palestine Stock Exchange. The electronic Signature is optional in most transactions and trades between the Stock Exchange and the brokerage firms and their clients, which are conducted electronically. The study also tried to shed some light on and highlight the most critical legal and illegal obstacles that hinder using and applying electronic Signatures in the Palestinian business sector. The researchers came up with many recommendations. The most important recommendation relates to the establishment of an electronic transactions unit as stipulated in the Law and that it should be independent. They also recommended that the private sector companies be allowed to design and implement the programs necessary for electronic Signatures and the protection and securing of the electronic Signature. © Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH.

Part of the solution appears to be programming compliance into RegTech: technological solutions that facilitate compliance with and monitoring of regulatory requirements. In this contribution, we have distinguished three types of RegTech based on the party taking the initiative for its development: (i) Compliance RegTech, where financial institutions develop or acquire RegTech tools to facilitate compliance; (ii) Supervisory RegTech, where a supervisor imposes the use of a certain RegTech tool to facilitate compliance, supervision and/or enforcement; and (iii) Regulatory RegTech, where the regulator provides machine-readable and/or machine-executable regulation. This approach allows for a nuanced analysis of the benefits and challenges of RegTech, and of the changing role of supervisors in a RegTech era. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Iris H-Y Chiu and Gudula Deipenbrock; individual chapters, the contributors.","","","","","","","","","Arner, Douglas W., FinTech, regTech, and the reconceptualization of financial regulation, Northwestern Journal of International Law and Business, 37, 3, pp. 373-415, (2017); Fintech and Regtech in A Nutshell and the Future in A Sandbox, (2017); Georgetown Journal of International Affairs, (2017); Bamberger, Kenneth A., Technologies of compliance: Risk and regulation in a digital age, Texas Law Review, 88, 4, pp. 669-739, (2010); Barberis, Janos N., The REGTECH book: The financial technology handbook for investors, entrepreneurs and visionaries in regulation, The REGTECH Book: The Financial Technology Handbook for Investors, Entrepreneurs and Visionaries in Regulation, pp. 1-386, (2019); Corporate Governance Principles for Banks, (2015); Baxter, Lawrence G., Adaptive financial regulation and regtech: A concept article on realistic protection for victims of bank failures, Duke Law Journal, 66, 3, pp. 567-604, (2016); Innovative Technology in Financial Supervision Suptech the Experience of Early Users, (2018); Brummer, Chris J., Fintech and the innovation trilemma, Georgetown Law Journal, 107, 2, pp. 235-307, (2019); Buckley, Ross P., The road to RegTech: the (astonishing) example of the European Union, Journal of Banking Regulation, 21, 1, pp. 26-36, (2020)","","","Taylor and Francis","","","","","","","9781000364644; 9780367344146","","","English","Routledge Handb. of Financial Technology and Law","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110754947"

Many organisations appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO) to assist them with their demonstration of compliance with the GDPR Principle of Accountability. The challenge for the DPO is to monitor these complex processing activities and to advise and inform the organisation with regard to the organisations demonstration of compliance with the Principle of Accountability. A review of GDPR compliance software solutions shows that organisations are being greatly challenged in meeting compliance obligations as set out under the GDPR, despite the myriad of software tools available to them. Many organisations continue to take a manual and informal approach to GDPR compliance. Our analysis shows significant gaps on the part of GDPR tools in their ability to demonstrate compliance in that they lack interoperability features, and they are not supported by published methodologies or evidence to support their validity or even utility. In contrast, RegTech has brought great success to financial compliance, using technological solutions to facilitate compliance with, and the monitoring of regulatory requirements. A review of the State of the Art identified the four success features of a RegTech system to be, strong data governance, automation through technology, interoperability of systems and a proactive regulatory framework. This paper outlines a set of requirements for GDPR compliance tools based on the RegTech experience and evaluate how these success features could be applied to improve GDPR compliance. A proof of concept prototype GDPR compliance tool was explored using the four success factors of RegTech, in which RegTech best practice was applied to regulator based self-assessment checklist to establish if the demonstration of GDPR compliance could be improved. The application of a RegTech success factors provides opportunities for demonstrable and validated GDPR compliance, notwithstanding the risk reductions and cost savings that RegTech can deliver and can facilitate organisations in meeting their GDPR compliance obligations. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Accountability; Compliance; Data protection officer; GDPR; RegTech","Demonstrations; Information systems; Information use; Interoperability; Privacy by design; Complex processing; Data governances; Geographical locations; Heterogeneous processing; Regulatory frameworks; Regulatory requirements; Software solution; Technological solution; Regulatory compliance","","","","","Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, (13/RC/2106); Science Foundation Ireland, SFI; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF; ADAPT - Centre for Digital Content Technology","Acknowledgements.

Many financial institutions are struggling with ever-changing regulatory requirements and the increased burden of intricate rules. Such rules can be conflicting, and subjected to local implementation and jurisdictic interpretation. Non-compliance or the inability to meet the deadlines subject institutions to hefty penalties and multimillion-dollar fines for failures in controlling nefarious and over-the-counter trading activities. In this chapter, we map out ongoing regulatory milestones globally to understand the main supervisory priorities by territory and propose how financial institutions can successfully administer regulatory change through an AI-driven regulatory management model within their organizations. We discuss the evolution, challenges and recommendations for financial institutions (including Shariah compliance) in the change management for regulations using a structured approach that addresses regional priorities. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Anti-money laundering; Customer due diligence; Data privacy and protection; OTC reform","","","","","","","","Arner, Douglas W., FinTech, regTech, and the reconceptualization of financial regulation, Northwestern Journal of International Law and Business, 37, 3, pp. 373-415, (2017); Global Regulatory Outlook 2019 2021, (2018); Action Task Force Guidance for A Risk Based Approach the Banking Sector, (2014); undefined; Inside Big Data, (2014); Mckinsey Exhibit, (2016); Financial Technology and Disruptive Innovation in Asean, (2020); undefined; Sponsored by Herjavec Group, (2017); Economics Business and Islamic Finance in Asean Economics Community, (2020)","H.

The current European regulation on public communications networks is aware of this assumption and currently requires that Telecommunications Service Providers (TSPs) take appropriate technical and organizational measures to manage the risks posed to the security of networks and services. In this context, risk management has become both a key aspect for dealing with security and a main trust vector included particularly in regulations. In this context, our paper concerns the establishment of a national security risk management framework to comply with national and European regulations for TSPs. This framework is composed of two parts: a security risk management tool to be used by the TSPs and an analysis tool to be used by the regulatory authority to gather and assess the risk management reports from the TSPs. The latter is specifically used to benchmark the security level of TSPs and the security of the sector as a whole. This paper reports on the design of this framework and the challenges emerging after an entire regulatory cycle. © 2020 Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology.

The banking industry changed massively after the financial crisis of 2008. New regulations and enforcements are being imposed on banks causing the compliance cost to increase dramatically. RegTech has been invented by technology firms acting as a potential solution to banks. The study will demonstrate the ability of RegTech to reduce the compliance cost, strengthen money laundering prevention and reduce the reputational risk in banking sectors. This study target sample was banks’ employees in Bahrain because of their proper knowledge about anti-money laundering. Data were collected from 100 respondents from the banking sector of Bahrain. Descriptive analysis was used to analyze the data while regression model and Spearman’s correlation were used to test the hypothesis.

Today, finance is not only the world's most globalized segment, but also among the most digitized. This process is evident across four major areas: the emergence of global wholesale markets, a spike in financial technology startups since 2008, an unprecedented digital transformation in the financial sector of developing countries (especially in China), and the growing role played in financial services by large technology firms (TechFin) as well as increasing real-time interconnections. The Digital Financial Process Transformation carries with it systemic changes. This improvement has optimistic, but also detrimental, consequences in the form of new threats. Although finance and technology have always collaborated and assisted each other, there have been extraordinary changes over the time after the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, especially in terms of the pace of change and the scale of new entrants. Pace of transition can be seen in particular in the position of emerging technology, also summarized as the ABCD framework: artificial intelligence (""AI""), blockchain, cloud and technology, which are rapidly co-evolving with finance. Many would add mobile Internet and Internet of Things (""IoT"") to this framework as well (Buckley, 2019).

Regulatory technology actually includes two aspects of 'compliance' and 'supervision', which can help financial institutions to reduce compliance costs and enhance compliance with internal control; Regulatory technology can also help regulatory agencies to enhance regulatory efficiency and reduce regulatory pressure. The essence is to use science and technology as an important path to achieve supervision. How to correctly apply regulatory technology to better improve the level of risk monitoring in the Internet finance field has become an urgent problem for financial regulatory authorities and industry self-regulatory organizations in various countries and regions to solve. Combined with logit model thinking, the construction concept of regulatory science and technology should at least include four dimensions: macro policy, business attributes, data modeling and technical path. It is recommended to improve the theoretical framework of supervisory technology and the study of its supervisory path, promote the construction of supervisory technology standards, expand the application of supervisory technology achievements, and effectively improve the level of risk monitoring in Internet finance. © 2020 IEEE.","compliance technology; Internet finance; logit model; monitoring concept; regulatory technology; risk monitoring","Compliance control; Data handling; Finance; Logistic regression; Financial institution; Regulatory agencies; Regulatory authorities; Regulatory organizations; Regulatory pressure; Science and Technology; Technology standards; Theoretical framework; Regulatory compliance","","","","","","","Bis Innovative Technology in Financial Supervision Suptech the Experience Ofearly Users R, (2018); Fca Call for Input Supporting the Development and Adoption of Regtech R, (2015); Fsb Financial Stability Implications from Fintech R, (2017); Iif Regtech in Financial Services Technology Solutions for Compliance and Reporting R, (2016); Fsi Innovative Technology in Financial Supervi Sion Suptech the Experience of Early Users R, (2018); Financial Regulation Research","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2nd International Conference on Economic Management and Model Engineering, ICEMME 2020","2020-11-20 through 2020-11-22","Chongqing","169155","","9781728191447","","","English","Proc. - Int.

The primary data for this study was collected through a survey instrument distributed to 100 bankers working in Bahrain with expertise in compliance.

Yet little is really understood about its meaning, legal implications, and policy consequences. In this article we introduce DeFi, put DeFi in the context of the traditional financial economy, connect DeFi to open banking, and end with some policy considerations. We suggest that decentralization has the potential to undermine traditional forms of accountability and erode the effectiveness of traditional financial regulation and enforcement. At the same time, we find that where parts of the financial services value chain are decentralized, there will be a reconcentration in a different (but possibly less regulated, less visible, and less transparent) part of the value chain. DeFi regulation could, and should, focus on this reconcentrated portion of the value chain to ensure effective oversight and risk control. Rather than eliminating the need for regulation, in fact DeFi requires regulation in order to achieve its core objective of decentralization. Furthermore, DeFi potentially offers an opportunity for the development of an entirely new way to design regulation: the idea of ‘embedded regulation’. Regulatory approaches could be built into the design of DeFi, thus potentially decentralizing both finance and its regulation, in the ultimate expression of RegTech. © The Author(s) 2020.

Further, theoretical support for the role of internal corporate whistleblowers can be found in the smart regulation paradigm, which points to the potential for whistleblowers to operate as surrogate regulators. In light of this, the potential impact of fast-developing ‘RegTech’ applications on corporate whistleblowing activity has significant regulatory implications. While ‘first’ generation RegTech applications such as improved data analytics already have the capability to assist corporations to implement more efficient internal whistleblowing systems, the rise of second-generation AI-powered RegTech technologies is likely to further disrupt, and potentially transform, the practice of whistleblowing in corporations. As AI advances, internal corporate whistleblowers may be supplemented, or even replaced, by ‘whistlebots’ with the ability to report autonomously, with dramatic implications for the role of whistleblowing as a corporate regulatory device. © 2020, University of New South Wales Law Journal.

The rise of fintech driven by nonbank entities (technology startups, finance, big tech and big retail companies) helps to transform financial services industry, but also threatens the market positions of traditional banks and through them potentially the stability of the financial system. The current EU proposals, as presented in the Commission’s Fintech Action Plan published in 2018 and follow-up measures, outlined a number of steps to support fintech, while ensuring the protection of market stability and consumers and the maintenance of level playing field in the financial services markets. The article argues that, while the Commission’s proposed policy mix contains certain positive measures for fintech, it remains, overall, conservative and favours the incumbents. It also argues that unless the Commission becomes bolder and adopts a more flexible legal framework for fintech (for which the article makes specific recommendations), the latter will not grow at the pace needed to help build a competitive advantage for the EU financial sector. The Commission’s continuing support of the established market landscape dominated by financial conglomerates employing traditional business models risks undermining the ability of the European financial system to adapt to the changing competition landscape created by advancing financial technologies and to fully address stability concerns, which emerged as a result of the financial crisis ©2020 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands","artificial intelligence; big data; crowdfunding; crypto-assets; EU; fintech; GDPR; plan; regtech; regulation","","","","","","","","His Research Interests Include Banking Finance Law Law of Information Technology Commercial Law Law of Sustainable Development and Competition Law; 150 Years of Fintech an Evolutionary Analysis; Bis Quarterly Review, (2018); undefined; Impact of Digital Innovation on the Processing of Electronic Payments and Contracting an Overview of Legal Risks, (2017); Own Initiative Report on Initial Coin Offerings and Crypto Assets Advice to Esma, (2018); Global Monitoring Report on Non Bank Financial Intermediation 2018, (2019); Stacey English and Susannah Hammond Cost of Compliance 2018, (2017); Global Bank Risk Management Survey Accelerating Digital Transformation Ninth Annual Ey Iif Survey; Competition Issues in the Area of Financial Technology Fintech Policy Department for Economic Scientific and Quality of Life Policies, (2018)","","","Kluwer Law International","","","","","","09596941","","","","English","Eur.

The full potential of FinTech to support the SDGs may be realized with a progressive approach to the development of underlying infrastructure to support digital financial transformation. Our research suggests that the best way to think about such a strategy is to focus on four primary pillars. The first pillar requires the building of digital identity, simplified account opening and e-KYC systems, supported by the second pillar of open interoperable electronic payments systems. The third pillar involves using the infrastructure of the first and second pillars to underpin electronic provision of government services and payments. The fourth pillar—design of digital financial markets and systems—supports broader access to finance and investment. Implementing the four pillars is a major journey for any economy, but one which has tremendous potential to transform not only finance but economies and societies, through FinTech, financial inclusion and sustainable balanced development. © 2020, T.M.C.

The paper analyses these four pillars and suggests that together they are underpinning the development of a RegTech ecosystem in Europe and will continue to do so. We argue that the European Union’s financial services and data protection regulatory reforms have unintentionally driven the use of regulatory technologies (RegTech) by intermediaries, supervisors and regulators, and provided an environment within which RegTech can flourish. The experiences of Europe in this process will provide insights for other societies in developing their own RegTech ecosystems in order to support more efficient, stable, inclusive financial systems. © 2019, Springer Nature Limited.","Data protection; Digital identity; European Union; Financial regulation; FinTech; General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR); Open banking; Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD 2); RegTech","","","","","","Australian Research Council, ARC","Acknowledgements We would like to thank for support of this research the Australian Research Council as part of the Project, ‘Regulating a Revolution: A New Regulatory Model for Digital Finance’ and the Hong Kong Research Grants Council Research Impact Fund, as well as participants at the European Banking Institute annual conference in Frankfurt in February 2019 for their comments and Rohan Balani, Pamela Cela, Tsany Ratna Dewi, Zak Vidor Staub, and Robin Veidt for their most helpful research assistance.","From Crisis to Crisis the Global Financial System and Regulatory Failure, (2011); Reconceptualising Global Finance and Its Regulation, (2016); Arner, Douglas W., FinTech, regTech, and the reconceptualization of financial regulation, Northwestern Journal of International Law and Business, 37, 3, pp. 373-415, (2017); Regtech in Financial Services Technology Solutions for Compliance and Reporting, (2016); Journal of Financial Transformation, (2016); Revue Trimestrielle De Droit Financier, (2017); Oj L, (2011); No 648 2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2012 on Otc Derivatives Central Counterparties and Trade Repositories, (2012); Oj L, (2013); Oj L, (2014)","R.P.

The paper summarizes the research and findings in this emerging field. Thereafter, it identifies the gaps and provides directions for further research. Simultaneously, the paper collates technical terms related to FinTech that appear repeatedly in each category and explains them. Finally, the study highlights the lessons that growing FinTech firms and their regulators can learn from the experiences of their counterparts across the globe. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic review of literature consisting of 130 studies (social science research network [SSRN]-29 papers, Scopus-81, other sources-20) on FinTech is carried out in this thematic paper. Findings: This thematic paper divides FinTech into three themes, i.e. financial industry, innovation/technology and law/regulation. The paper suggests that a thorough impact of FinTech on various stakeholders can be understood using three dimensions, namely, consumers, market players and regulatory front. It is noted that FinTech is in its nascent phase and is undergoing continuous development and implementation through product and process innovation, disruption and transformation. Research limitations/implications: The paper reports that FinTech promises huge potential for further study by various stakeholders in the FinTech industry – from academia to practitioners to regulators. Practical implications: The paper summarizes lessons that could be of significance for FinTech users, producers, entrepreneurs, investors, policy designers and regulators. Originality/value: The paper is believed to add value to the understanding of FinTech in light of the emerging threats and opportunities for its various stakeholders. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Big data; Blockchain; Crowdfunding; Cryptocurrency; Entrepreneurial finance; FinTech; ICOs; Innovation; P2P lending; Regtech; Regulatory sandbox; Shadow banking","","","","","","","","Adhami, Saman, Why do businesses go crypto?

With the rise of technologies such as big data and artificial intelligence in recent years, agent-based modeling and basic supporting technologies in the field of FinTech are deeply integrated to jointly promote continuous breakthroughs in FinTech. In particular, in the fields of big data ontology research, agent-based model calibration, investor behavior modeling, regulatory technology applications, etc., agent-based modeling has demonstrated its unique advantages in integrating with FinTech. From the perspectives of big data ontology, agent-based modeling is an effective method that uses financial big data ontology modeling to depict the correlation between financial entities and to study their causal relationships. From the perspectives of artificial intelligence, it provides the basis for fine modeling of individuals and behavioral evolution modeling, and agent-based modeling provides a new research frame-work for algorithmic trading. From the perspectives of regulatory technology, the agent-based model in the development process to promote the formation of a new 'scenario-response' type of risk management, thus providing supports for the 'regulatory technology' development. This paper holds that agent-based modeling can be integrated with the basic supporting technologies of FinTech, providing an important impetus for the development of agent-based modeling and regulatory innovation in FinTech. © 2020, Editorial Board of Journal of Systems Engineering Society of China.

Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative methodology is used in conducting this research where relevant literature on ṣukūk was reviewed. Through a doctrinal approach, the paper presents analyses on the practice of ṣukūk and ṣukūk on blockchain by discussing its legal, Sharīʾah and regulatory issues. This culminates in a conceptual analysis of blockchain ṣukūk and its peculiar challenges. Findings: This paper reveals that digitizing ṣukūk issuance through blockchain remedies certain inefficiencies associated with ṣukūk transactions. Indeed, structuring ṣukūk on a blockchain platform can increase transparency of underlying ṣukūk assets and cash flows in addition to reducing costs and the number of intermediaries in ṣukūk transactions. The paper likewise brings to light legal, regulatory, Sharīʾah and cyber risks associated with ṣukūk on blockchain that confront investors, practitioners and regulators. This calls for deeper collaboration in research among Sharīʾah scholars, lawyers, regulators and information technology experts. Research limitations/implications: As a pioneering subject, the paper notes the prospects of blockchain ṣukūk and the current dearth of literature on it. The paper would assist relevant Islamic capital market entities and authorities to determine the potential and impact of blockchain ṣukūk in their respective businesses and the financial system. Practical implications: Blockchain ṣukūk will assist in addressing issues inherent in classical ṣukūk and in paving the way to innovative solutions that will facilitate and enhance the quality of ṣukūk transactions. For that, ṣukūk would require appropriate regulatory technology to address its governance and regulation peculiarities. Originality/value: Integrating ṣukūk with blockchain technology will add value to it. The paper advances the idea that blockchain ṣukūk revolutionises ṣukūk and enhances its practice against known inadequacies. © 2020, Sherin Kunhibava, Zakariya Mustapha, Aishath Muneeza, Auwal Adam Sa'ad and Mohammad Ershadul Karim.","Blockchain; Blockchain technology; Legal issues; Regtech; Regulatory issues; Sharīʾah; Ṣukūk","","","","","","(IF057A-2018)","Funding text 1: The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support provided by QRC plc and IBH, Research Grant number IF057A-2018.; Funding text 2: The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support provided by QRC plc and IBH, Research Grant number IF057A-2018.

The concept of Regulatory Technology, or RegTech, in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is still in the infant stage due to lack of defined processes and it holds immense potential in employing RegTech to its existing institutions. The purpose of this paper is to understand the various factors that determine the adoption for RegTech services and proposes a multi-criteria decision-making approach by ranking those determinants. The determinants are divided into three main hierarchies which include customers, regulators, and environment-based factors. Survey was conducted to rank each of the determinants within the hierarchy to validate the need for RegTech services. It is observed that customer-centric experience, enhancing data security and ensuring real-time data capabilities play the major factors for the implementation of RegTech services that is validated by constructing an AHP model. The need for RegTech's determinants would help financial institutions, regulators, and stakeholders in the UAE benefit from the research and achieve competitive advantage by understanding and implementing the suggested findings. © © 2020 for this paper by its authors.","Analytical hierarchy process; Compliance; RegTech; Regulatory monitoring","Competition; Decision making; Security of data; Competitive advantage; Customer-centric; Financial institution; Identity management; Major factors; Multi criteria decision making; Real-time data; United Arab Emirates; Regulatory compliance","","","","","","","Anagnostopoulos, Yiannis, Fintech and regtech: Impact on regulators and banks, Journal of Economics and Business, 100, pp. 7-25, (2018); Journal of Financial Transformation, (2016); Arner, Douglas W., FinTech, regTech, and the reconceptualization of financial regulation, Northwestern Journal of International Law and Business, 37, 3, pp. 373-415, (2017); Research Foundation Briefs, (2017); Georgetown Journal of International Affairs, (2017); Call for Input Supporting the Development and Adoption of Regtech, (2015); Kne Social Sciences, (2018); Butler, Tom, Understanding RegTech for Digital Regulatory Compliance, Palgrave Studies in Digital Business and Enabling Technologies, pp. 85-102, (2019); Revue Internationale Des Services Financiers International Journal for Financial Services Risf, (2017); Fintech Regtech and the Role of Compliance Report 2019, (2019)","","Afli, H.; Bleimann, U.; Burkhardt, D.; Loew, R.; Loew, R.; Regier, S.; Stengel, I.; Wang, H.; Zheng, H.","CEUR-WS","","6th Collaborative European Research Conference, CERC 2020","2020-09-10 through 2020-09-11","Virtual, Belfast","167113","16130073","9789666544899; 9788073780029; 9788024810256; 9789986342748; 9788073781712; 9782954494807; 9788024823911; 9789562361989; 8024810255; 807378002X","","","English","CEUR Workshop Proc.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101611682"

We would like to examine the experiences of technology integration applied to the regulation of the markets and to the compliace, in the banking sector in Italy. Our paper responds to a gap in literature that on the subject of regtech is mainly based on legal, defining arguments and about reviewing the literature on the macro context and the issues generated by the huge amount of regulation. The article will explore three cases of RegTech companies in Italy presenting advantages and criticalities in the adoption of regtech solutions on the Italian market. Methods/Approach: Today the literature about case study in RegTech is not proposing any solution of cooperation on the regulatory field in Italy. So we have to fill the gap we find in exploration of literature. An analysis in the field cannot be separated from a preliminary systematic review of the literature on regulatory case studies. We begin our scientific analysis of the subject through a preliminary literature review individuating any case study around RegTech through exploratory case study. Due to the scarcity of papers about case study in RegTech field, we adopt an approach already used for well-studied cases widespread in the FinTech area and an exploratory investigation through in deep interviews following models used in FinTech area and in ERM field. Results/Findings: In this article, we will, therefore, propose case studies in the FinTech sector applied to regulatory technology in Italy and we expect to answer the following research questions: We present three RegTech's cases in Italy's financial system exposing the fields of collaboration with financial institutions in RegTech field between incumbents and RegTech industries. We expose also how big I.T. companies, which are providing services for banks, are refocusing and improving compliance through RegTech to provide services linked to compliance, Kyc, Aml, privacy, payments to the incumbents. In conclusion we express topics interested by cooperation between banks and RegTech companies describing the potetial expansion lines. Implications: Understand how financial companies through regulatory technology can: Improve risk management and governance in financial institutions. Improve prudential compliance, anti money laundering and customer protection. Reduce the risks of traditional banking business through better knowledge and customer identification and profiling may also offer more favourable terms to companies and lowering compliance costs to shift economic resources towards FinTech's disruptive innovation. © 2020 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

A survey of GDPR compliance software solutions shows significant gaps in their ability to demonstrate compliance. In contrast, RegTech has recently brought great success to financial compliance, resulting in reduced risk, cost saving and enhanced financial regulatory compliance. It is shown that many GDPR solutions lack interoperability features such as standard APIs, meta-data or reports and they are not supported by published methodologies or evidence to support their validity or even utility. A proof of concept prototype was explored using a regulator based self-assessment checklist to establish if RegTech best practice could improve the demonstration of GDPR compliance. The application of a RegTech approach provides opportunities for demonstrable and validated GDPR compliance, notwithstanding the risk reductions and cost savings that RegTech can deliver. This paper demonstrates a RegTech approach to GDPR compliance can facilitate an organisation meeting its accountability obligations. © © 2020 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

This paper presents a human-centred, knowledge-driven approach to regulatory reporting. A given regulation is represented in a controlled natural language form including its metadata and bindings, with the assistance of subject matter experts. This representation of a semi-formal controlled natural language translates into a self-executable formal representation via a context-free grammar. A meta reasoner with the knowledge to execute the given self-executable formal representation while generating regulatory reports including explanations on derived results has been developed. Finally, the proposed approach has been implemented as a prototype and validated in the realm of financial regulation: Money Market Statistical Reporting Regulation. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Banking; Compliance; Explainability; Finance; Human-centred; Knowledge systems; Reasoning; RegTech; Regulations; Rule-based systems","Context free grammars; Context free languages; Intelligent systems; Automated reasoning; Controlled natural language; Financial regulations; Formal representations; Laws and regulations; Level of automations; Statistical reporting; Subject matter experts; Laws and legislation","","","","","","","22nd International Conference on Applications of Declarative Programming and Knowledge Management, (2019); Araszkiewicz, Michał, Analogy, similarity and factors, Proceedings of the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, pp. 101-105, (2011); Arner, Douglas W., FinTech, regTech, and the reconceptualization of financial regulation, Northwestern Journal of International Law and Business, 37, 3, pp. 373-415, (2017); Beach, Thomas H., A rule-based semantic approach for automated regulatory compliance in the construction sector, Expert Systems with Applications, 42, 12, pp. 5219-5231, (2015); Butler, Tom, Understanding RegTech for Digital Regulatory Compliance, Palgrave Studies in Digital Business and Enabling Technologies, pp. 85-102, (2019); Berkeley Technology Law Journal, (2019); Ruleml 2016 Challenge Doctoral Consortium and Industry Track Hosted by the 10th International Web Rule Symposium Ruleml 2016, (2016); IBM AI in Regtech A Quiet Upheaval, (2018); Regulatory Knowledge Representation for Automated Compliance Audit of Bim Based Models, (2013); Global Regulatory Outlook 2018 Viewpoint 2018 Opinions on Global Financial Services Regulation and Industry Developments for the Year Ahead, (2018)","D.J.

This tendency can be seen in numerous emerging regulations imposing a riskbased approach for IS security on entire economic sectors. However, a major drawback of the methods currently used is that risks are assessed individually by each organization for its own activities, and that no link is established between the risk management results of interacting organizations. In this paper, we propose an approach to deal with systemic risks, i.e. risks propagated from one organization to another due to dependencies between them.

The fundamental purpose of the regulatory sandbox is to facilitate the development of fintech, especially the ‘disruptive innovation’ activities of the start-up enterprises. In this sense, the regulatory sandbox is a sub-category of the regulation of fintech. Fintech is technology-enabled financial innovation, synonymous with the term ‘internet finance’ in the Chinese context. A different but related term, the regulatory technology (regtech), in a broad sense refers to a combination of the ‘compliance technology’ by the market players with the ‘regulatory technology’ by the regulators. In nature, the regulatory sandbox is conditional, limited, and controlled deregulation. It was primarily a reaction to the somehow overly burdensome regulatory requirements after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), thus leaving a ‘lifeline’ for financial innovation and, in particular, fintech. The situation is very different in China, where the major problem for internet finance it not over-regulation but under-regulation. With a vast territory, diversified areas, and numerous institutions, China does not feature a much developed and high concentrated financial market like that of the UK, Singapore, or the HK SAR. Nor does it have an integrated financial regulatory system. And, most importantly, the existing mechanisms in China are capable of performing equivalent or even more functions than the sandbox, which, if copied in China, would be redundant. In short, the regulatory sandbox is admittedly a remarkable innovation in terms of regulatory ideas and approaches conducive to financial innovation, especially fintech. However, with its specific background, exterior conditions, and intrinsic limitations, it is by no means an inevitable choice or universal model for the regulation of fintech. Based on the actual circumstances, it’s not desirable for China to introduce the sandbox, at least for the time being. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.","Adaptive regulation; Disruptive innovation; Financial technology (fintech); Regulatory sandbox; Regulatory technology (regtech)","","","","","","","","Georgetown Journal of International Law, (2015); Arner, Douglas W., FinTech, regTech, and the reconceptualization of financial regulation, Northwestern Journal of International Law and Business, 37, 3, pp. 373-415, (2017); Sound Practices Implications of Fintech Developments for Banks and Bank Supervisors, (2017); S Afr L J, (2011); Treasury Report Endorses Fintech Bank Charters Sandboxes, (2018); Brummer, Chris J., Disruptive technology and securities regulation, Fordham Law Review, 84, 3, pp. 977-1052, (2015); Policy on no Action Letters, (2016); Fca Feedback Statement Fs 16 4 to Call for Input on Supporting the Development and Adopters of Regtech, (2016); Regulatory Sandbox Lessons Learned Report, (2017); Regulatory Sandbox","F.

Mapping and analysing the plethora of legal implications of rapidly further evolving financial technology have gained momentum. The paper aims to contribute to it. Focus is on the German view. The following questions have inspired the analysis: How might FinTech best be defined and its most important manifestations best be systematized for legal purposes? Have the most pressing legal issues been addressed, so far? The paper considers the legal challenges of FinTech as huge, reaching far beyond financial markets. It argues that artificial intelligence and machine learning deserve utmost attention particularly in this context. The paper postulates that the law-being well-equipped to control the complex, constantly morphing risks of financial innovation while allowing exploiting its benefits-shall not just react to but lead the transformation. The present author considers particularly legal academia responsible for continuously steering and shaping a balanced and objective discourse leading to adequate legal responses in the realm of FinTech. It is time to reassert the crucial role of law in times of deep technological change not only in financial markets. 'It is a world of change-unparalleled, unsettling, dizzying change. The certainties of yesterday are the doubts of today, and the folly and mockery of tomorrow.

Design/methodology/approach: In this research, an implementation procedure for a selected Process Mining application is developed and evaluated at a financial institution in Germany. Findings: The evaluation of the process data with the Process Mining application Disco shows that the compliance of the real-life execution of business processes can be monitored in real-time. Moreover, potential non-compliant activities and durations can be analysed in a detailed manner. Research limitations/implications: When the research results are regarded, it must be considered that a general condition for the usage of a Process Mining application is that the process data is available and exportable in the required format and that data privacy regulations are fulfilled. Originality/value: This research presents a practical use case for the implementation of a Process Mining application at the risk management department of financial institutions. It shows the value of using a technical application to carry out tedious tasks that are usually executed manually. This value is discussed and compared with the aim to help financial institutions in determining how the effectiveness and efficiencies of compliance management activities can be improved. Therefore, this research can be taken as a foundation for the practical implementation of a Process Mining application at financial institutions. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Compliance management; Financial regulation; Process mining; RegTech; Regulatory compliance","","","","","","","","Allen, Franklin, The Interplay among Financial Regulations, Resilience, and Growth, Journal of Financial Services Research, 53, 2-3, pp. 141-162, (2018); Rundschreiben 09 2017 Ba Mindestanforderungen an Das Risikomanagement Marisk, (2017); Review of Finance and Banking, (2018); Becker, Jörg, Business process compliance checking – Applying and evaluating a generic pattern matching approach for conceptual models in the financial sector, Information Systems Frontiers, 18, 2, pp. 359-405, (2016); Bergener, Philipp, Detecting potential weaknesses in business processes: An exploration of semantic pattern matching in process models, Business Process Management Journal, 21, 1, pp. 25-54, (2015); Boella, Guido, Managing legal interpretation in regulatory compliance, Proceedings of the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, pp. 23-32, (2013); Process Mining Technologie, (2018); Myinvenio Process Analyst, (2018); de Vreede, Gert Jan, Integrating the conceptualization and simulation of business processes: A modeling method and arena template, Simulation, 79, 1, pp. 43-55, (2003); Banking Supervision, (2017)","M.

The adoption of a shared data architecture, whereby the regulator is provided with seamless access to the accounts of regulated firms, may result in the development of a centralized approach to regulatory modelling, thus bypassing the existing partition between internal models and standardized approaches. Secondly, this article discusses how, thanks to the adoption of advanced predictive analytics, non-bank fintech lenders can gain insights into borrowers' creditworthiness irrespective of banks' control over traditional sources of information for credit scoring. This, though, may give rise to a new type of strategic gaming, this time by borrowers keen to maximize their chances of being granted a loan. In any case, preventing banks from adopting these new methods for the purpose of regulatory modelling might weaken their competitiveness. Thirdly, this article explores whether the transition to a centralized approach for credit risk management would conflate the distinction between microprudential and macroprudential interventions, in particular with respect to the countercyclical macroprudential policy. Finally, the article argues that non-bank (fintech) firms could be persuaded to coalesce behind endorsement of the new regulatory shared data platform in return for the support from the central bank. In this way, the regulatory perimeter could be extended in order to steer the adoption of financial innovations in a manner that benefits society overall. © The Author(s) 2019.

The transformational potential of RegTech has been confirmed in recent years with US$1.2 billion invested in start-ups (2017) and an expected additional spending of US$100 billion by 2020.

This book, the first of its kind, is providing a comprehensive and invaluable source of information aimed at corporates, regulators, compliance professionals, start-ups and policy makers. The REGTECH Book brings into a single volume the curated industry expertise delivered by subject matter experts.

Services computing researchers will play an important role in advancing Regtech, but they must add to their repertoire additional knowledge of financial principles, an understanding of common Fintech pathologies that may be exploited by bad actors, and new thinking in regard to protecting customer data across multiple legal jurisdictions and the related compliance of boundary crossing banking-related algorithms. This paper uses supply chain finance as a use case to demonstrate details of this needed new repertoire. Ten areas of goal and constraint resetting relevant to Regtech software development and traditional services computing approaches are discussed. At stake is the need for services computing scholars to engage in developing some of the most critical software services of our age - those that can help to maintain and advance our market-based societies. © 2019 IEEE.","Fintech; Regtech; Supply Chain Finance","Commerce; Contracts; Finance; Regulatory compliance; Supply chains; Additional knowledge; Financial principles; Fintech; Regtech; Related algorithms; Supply chain finances; Traditional services; Transparent process; Software design","","","","","","","Regtech to Account for 40 of Global Compliance Spend by 2023 Rising Sixfold to 115 Billion, (2018); Mooney, Charles W., Fintech and secured transactions systems of the future, Law and Contemporary Problems, 81, 1, pp. 1-20, (2018); Tsai, Changhsien, The FinTech Revolution and Financial Regulation: The Case of Online Supply-Chain Financing, Asian Journal of Law and Society, 4, 1, pp. 109-132, (2017); World Government Summit, (2018); Future of Data Driven Finance and Regtech Lessons from Eu Big Bang II, (2019); Moretto, Antonella Maria, Supply chain finance: From traditional to supply chain credit rating, Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management, 25, 2, pp. 197-217, (2019); Kilu, Erki, Agile Software Process Improvement by Learning from Financial and Fintech Companies: LHV Bank Case Study, Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing, 338, pp. 57-69, (2019); Yang, Dong, Evolutionary Approaches and the Construction of Technology-Driven Regulations, Emerging Markets Finance and Trade, 54, 14, pp. 3256-3271, (2018)","M.

Building on the natural-resource-based view of the firm and the EI literature, this paper posits that firms need to renew and realign their capabilities, and ultimately develop distinctive sustainability-oriented capabilities, in order to meet the rapidly changing regulatory, technology, and market demands. Results of the analysis, based on a survey of U.K. firms, reveal that EIs are more likely to arise when firms (a) build capabilities on voluntary self-regulation (i.e., executive driven environmental management system and corporate social responsibility) because such organizational capabilities allow them to address increasing regulatory pressures; (b) invest in environmental research and development (i.e., eco-R&D)—instead of generic research and development—because it provides them with the relevant and specific technological capabilities to tackle technology shifts towards sustainability; and (c) develop capabilities in green market sensing as such capabilities allow them to address green consumption needs. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment","CSR; eco-innovation; EMS; environmental research and development; sustainability-oriented capabilities; voluntary self-regulation","corporate social responsibility; environmental management; innovation; market conditions; research and development; sustainability; United Kingdom","","","","","","","Albort-Morant, Gema, The antecedents of green innovation performance: A model of learning and capabilities, Journal of Business Research, 69, 11, pp. 4912-4917, (2016); Amankwah-Amoah, Joseph, Entrepreneurial orientation, environmental sustainability and new venture performance: does stakeholder integration matter?, Business Strategy and the Environment, 28, 1, pp. 79-87, (2019); Aragón-Correa, Juan Alberto Alberto, The Influence of Technology Differences on Corporate Environmental Patents: A Resource-Based Versus an Institutional View of Green Innovations, Business Strategy and the Environment, 25, 6, pp. 421-434, (2016); Arimura, Toshih H., Is a voluntary approach an effective environmental policy instrument?.

However, our current understanding of how green-technology ventures emerge and diffuse more sustainable innovations remains limited. We advance theory on green entrepreneurship by drawing on institutional work to refine and extend our understanding of how entrepreneurs may influence government policies and practices in their attempts to diffuse green technology. We develop a theoretical framework that combines institutional work with a search tool, the technological, commercial, organizational, and societal (TCOS) framework of innovative uncertainties, which identifies key opportunities, hurdles, and potential unintended consequences at early stages of technology development. We present a detailed case study of a potential university-based green-tech venture developing pathogen detection technology for forestry protection. Foreign pathogens spread by international trade can have major detrimental impacts on forests and the industries that rely on them. Our analysis found that green technology demonstrating technological feasibility is necessary but not sufficient; green-tech ventures must also engage in institutional work, in this case, articulating the technology’s benefits to regulators to establish legitimacy and avoid misuse that can hinder its adoption. We thus add to previous studies by emphasizing that institutional work could be a main activity for a green-tech venture, a core entrepreneurial strategy rather than an afterthought. © 2017, The Author(s).","Green entrepreneurship; Green innovation; Institutional work; Regulatory technology adoption; Sustainable forestry; Technology development","","","","","","Genome Canada; Genome British Columbia, Genome BC","Funding for this research was supplied by Genome Canada, Genome British Columbia, and the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada.

At the same time, identification and know-your-customer rules can be major barriers to accessing financial services. This paper considers the various requirements for identification in the financial sector and the evolving nature of identity. We argue that technology presents an opportunity to solve this challenge through the development of digital identity infrastructure and related utilities. The establishment of such utilities requires addressing design questions such as registration methods, data availability, and cross-jurisdiction recognitions. Yet, as with any reform, a balance between flow through efficiency and cyber-security needs to be reached to ensure that the objectives of financial inclusion and market integrity are not achieved to the detriment of financial stability. © 2019, T.M.C.

We conclude with some thoughts on current limitations and views on how the field is likely to develop in the short- to medium-term.

It draws on the findings and outcomes of a five-year research programme to highlight the role that RegTech can play in making regulatory compliance more efficient and effective. The chapter presents research on the Bank of England/Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) RegTech Sprint initiative, whose objective was to demonstrate how straight-through processing of regulations and regulatory compliance reporting using semantically enabled applications can be made possible by RegTech. The chapter notes that the full benefits of RegTech will only materialise if the pitfalls of a fragmented Tower of Babel approach are avoided.

The biopolitics of the regime had to change to fit the new international situation and to protect the dictatorship from negative external influences that might challenge the essence of the Spain of Franco. Spaniards started have contact with different realities from theirs and the younger generation, with no direct experience of the Spanish Civil War, reacted almost immediately. Young people were the main actors in the antifrancoist social movement which started in Spain. At the same time some members of the younger generation were fascinated by pop culture, which played an important role in defining their identity as what was called ye-yé. As part of official information policy, more and more television programs were dedicated to this emerging audience and its interests. These programs were meant to be for entertainment only but, perhaps because of this, some of them were allowed to show social models that deviated from the norm, to a wide audience. The analysis of the TV program Último grito shows how mass media and regulating technologies were involved in the definition of identities that transformed radically the social and emotional structures of Spain in the last years of francoism.1. © Inter-Disciplinary Press 2014.","Cold War; Gender stereotypes; mass media; pop culture; regulatory technology; Spain; television; transition; Último grito","","","","","","","","Periodismo Y Franquismo De La Censura A La Apertura, (1995); 45 Revoluciones En Espana, (1972); Cayuela Sánchez, Salvador, The birth of Francoist bio-politics.

These include a wide array of tools to mitigate risks arising from the distinct risk factors that are further consolidated under the risk strategy of a specific enterprise. Any firm in space industry and outside of it faces risks that can be associated with the following key areas: strategic, reputational, regulatory, financial, operational, and cyber. Integrating high tech solutions into the risk mitigation process has now become available by implementing solutions based on artificial intelligence technology. Recent advances in risk management are numerous and include regulatory technology (RegTech) and financial technology (FinTech) solutions that are necessary in the competitive environment. Conservative risk mitigation methods are not fast paced enough to conduct numerous iterations in a split second timeframe and tackle arising risks. For instance, the new regulatory framework design for the company will be more efficient if it grounds on the RegTech concept. The latter automates the state-of-the-art risk mitigation methods and allows for integrating human expertise and newest technology. All in all, better governance and information management are key in the strategic risk management of any enterprise. Finally, risk mitigation plays a crucial role in reaching the organization's goals. © © 2019 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

Every year, these requirements are increasing and it has become a challenge for financial institutions to meet the requirements manually, due to the high cost and increasing number of complex compliance requirements. These compliance challenges created the market for RegTech, which is a part of FinTech industry, where the RegTech industry promise to act as a solution to reduce compliance cost and burden for financial institutions as well as regulators. The purpose of this paper is to present a systematic literature review conducted, on applying RegTech to reduce compliance cost and burden, while focusing on promising RegTech tools and various benefits and challenges of RegTech.

This would suggest that the new types of (traditional) banking services and the new type of (traditional) banking service providers have emerged in the market. The paper describes the commercial banking services, the set-up commercial banks operate in and the changes occurring in the market triggered by financial technology (the FinTech firms). When researching the effects of financial technology, the paper focuses on the trends in the market and the efficiencies the new services are responsible for. The new service providers have shown that they are meeting the demands of the consumers/clients that banks have not, such as crowdfunding, or battling financial inclusion. The grand issue surrounding the FinTech sector is the lack of applicable regulatory environment. Challenges the regulators are faced with when designing the regulation applicable to the financial technology are the speed the services are evolving with and choosing the right moment to place regulation. The lack of adequate regulation leaves customers/clients unprotected. Nevertheless, the FinTech sector is growing rapidly. Indications in the market suggest the FinTech firms are leading the way the commercial banking sector will follow. © 2019 University of Zagreb Faculty of Economics and Business.

Unfortunately, preventing money laundering is very difficult since money laundering always has a plausible trade characterization. To reach this goal, supervision for regulator and financial institutions aims to effectively monitor micro entities’ behavior in financial markets. The main purpose of this paper is to establish a monitoring method including accurate recognition and classified supervision for Trade-based Money Laundering by means of knowledge-driven multi-class classification algorithms associated with macro and micro prudential regulation, such that the model can forecast the predicted class from the concerned management areas. Based on empirical data from China, we demonstrate the application and explain how the monitor method can help to improve management efficiency in the financial market. © 2019 The Author(s).","Financial risk monitor; Machine learning; Macro-and micro-prudential regulation; Reg-tech; Trade-based Money Laundering","","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (1811462, 71433001, 71725001, 71874023); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This research has been partially supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (#71725001, #71874023, #71433001, and #U1811462).","Aglietta, Michel, A systemic approach to financial regulation A European perspective, Economie Internationale, 123, 3, pp. 31-65, (2010); Ahmed, Irfan, Forecasting investment and consumption behavior of economic agents through dynamic computable general equilibrium model, Financial Innovation, 4, 1, (2018); Allen, Franklin, Enhancing Prudential Standards in Financial Regulations, Journal of Financial Services Research, 49, 2-3, pp. 133-149, (2016); Arnold, Bruce R., Systemic risk, macroprudential policy frameworks, monitoring financial systems and the evolution of capital adequacy, Journal of Banking and Finance, 36, 12, pp. 3125-3132, (2012); Arthur, Keren Naa Abeka, Financial innovation and its governance: Cases of two major innovations in the financial sector, Financial Innovation, 3, 1, (2017); Simplice, Asongu Anutechia, Determinants of foreign direct investment in fast-growing economies: evidence from the BRICS and MINT countries, Financial Innovation, 4, 1, (2018); Ref Sourcetitle Ref Sourcetitle, (2003); Borio, Claudio E.V., Implementing a macroprudential framework: Blending boldness and realism, Capitalism and Society, 6, 1, (2011); Trade Based Money Laundering China Customs, (2011); Chao, Xiangrui, A cost-sensitive multi-criteria quadratic programming model for imbalanced data, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 69, 4, pp. 500-516, (2018)","G.

The financial crisis with serious corporate and mutual fund scandals raised the profile of compliance as governmental bodies, institutional and private investors introduced a ‘tsunami’ of financial regulations. Adopting a multi-level analysis, this study examines how regulatory technology was used by financial firms to meet their compliance obligations, pre- and post-crisis. Empirical data collected over 12 years examine the deployment of an investment management system in eight financial firms. Interviews with public regulatory bodies, financial institutions and technology providers reveal a culture of compliance with increased transparency, surveillance and accountability. Findings show that dialectic tensions arise as the pursuit of transparency, surveillance and accountability in compliance mandates is simultaneously rationalized, facilitated and obscured by regulatory technology. Responding to these challenges, regulatory bodies continue to impose revised compliance mandates on financial firms to force them to adapt their financial technologies in an ever-changing multi-jurisdictional regulatory landscape. © 2017, Association for Information Technology Trust.","accountability; compliance systems; ethics; financial crisis; financial technology; fintech; regtech; regulatory technology; surveillance","Financial markets; Information management; Investments; Monitoring; Privatization; Space surveillance; Transparency; accountability; ethics; Financial crisis; fintech; regtech; Regulatory compliance","","","","","","","Aloui, Riadh, Global financial crisis, extreme interdependences, and contagion effects: The role of economic structure?, Journal of Banking and Finance, 35, 1, pp. 130-141, (2011); Doing Critical Management Research, (2000); Arnold, Patricia J., Global financial crisis: The challenge to accounting research, Accounting, Organizations and Society, 34, 6-7, pp. 803-809, (2009); Turner Review on the Global Banking Crisis A Response from the Financial Services Forum, (2009); Avgerou, C., Social mechanisms for causal explanation in social theory based is research, Journal of the Association for Information Systems, 14, 8, pp. 399-419, (2013); Delaware Journal of Corporate Law, (2013); Bamberger, Kenneth A., Technologies of compliance: Risk and regulation in a digital age, Texas Law Review, 88, 4, pp. 669-739, (2010); Barratt, Edward, The later Foucault in organization and management studies, Human Relations, 61, 4, pp. 515-537, (2008); Barth, Mary E., How did financial reporting contribute to the financial crisis?, European Accounting Review, 19, 3, pp. 399-423, (2010); American Sociological Review, (1958)","D.P.

Technology-driven regulations focused on data monitoring could be a remedy for the inefficiency and ineffectiveness of traditional financial regulations and enhance effective protection of financial consumers’ rights and interests. This new regulatory model aims to build a system that integrates equal access to information on blockchain transactions by both parties to it (i.e., the regulators and the financial institutions they regulate) for the purpose of oversight, intelligent real-time oversight, and an experimental sandbox for developing regulatory technology. This dynamic and flexible financial regulatory system could effectively address fintech risks. ©, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","fintech; regtech; technology-driven regulation","","","","","","(17BFX098)","This article is a research project called Legal Issues of Technology-Driven Financial Regulation (Project Number: 17BFX098), which is sponsored by Chinese Social Science Fund.","Georgetown Journal of International Law, (2015); Research Foundation Briefs, (2017); Financial Regulation Chinese Version, (2017); Brummer, Chris J., Disruptive technology and securities regulation, Fordham Law Review, 84, 3, pp. 977-1052, (2015); Journal of Technology Law Policy, (2016); Regtech as A Response to Regulatory Expansion in the Financial Sector, (2018); Fintech Law Report E Banking Payments Commerce in the Mobile World, (2017); Financial Stability Implications from Fintech, (2017); Regtech in Financial Services Technology Solutions for Compliance and Reporting, (2016); Report of Financial Technology Industry Development and Legal Frontier, (2017)","M.

We further aim to offer various perspectives in order to aid the understanding of the disruptive potential of FinTech, and its implications for the wider financial ecosystem. By drawing upon very recent and highly topical research on this area this study examines the implications for financial institutions, and regulation especially when technology poses a challenge to the global banking and regulatory system. It is driven by a wide-ranging overview of the development, the current state, and possible future of fintech. This paper attempts to connect practitioner-led and academic research. While it draws on academic research, the perspective it takes is also practice-oriented. It relies on the current academic literature as well as insights from industry sources, action research and other publicly available commentaries. It also draws on professional practitioners’ roundtable discussions, and think-tanks in which the author has been an active participant. We attempt to interpret banking, and regulatory issues from a behavioural perspective. The last crisis exposed significant failures in regulation and supervision. It has made the Financial Market Law and Compliance a key topic on the current agenda. Disruptive technological change also seems to be important in investigating regulatory compliance followed by change. We contribute to the current literature review on financial and digital innovation by new entrants where this has also practical implications. We also provide for an updated review of the current regulatory issues addressing the contextual root causes of disruption within the financial services domain. The aim here is to assist market participants to improve effectiveness and collaboration. The difficulties arising from extensive regulation may suggest a more liberal and principled approach to financial regulation. Disruptive innovation has the potential for welfare outcomes for consumers, regulatory, and supervisory gains as well as reputational gains for the financial services industry. It becomes even more important as the financial services industry evolves. For example, the preparedness of the regulators to instil culture change and harmonise technological advancements with regulation could likely achieve many desired outcomes. Such results range from achieving an orderly market growth, further aiding systemic stability and restoring trust and confidence in the financial system. Our action-led research results have implications for both research and practice. These should be of interest to regulatory standard setters, investors, international organisations and other academics who are researching regulatory and competition issues, and their manifestation within the financial and social contexts. As a perspective on a social construct, this study appeals to regulators and law makers, entrepreneurs, and investors who participate in technology applied within the innovative financial services domain. It is also of interest to bankers who might consider FinTech and strategic partnerships as a prospective, future strategic direction.1 © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Business models; Financial services; FinTech; Future research direction; RegTech; Regulation","","","","","","","Finally, only a few companies around the world are able to quickly export their fintech/regtech products and services to other countries. These are usually the ‘first movers’ and they are strongly financed by established financial markets and supported by advanced technology-platforms for scaling. For smaller markets, the small and medium-sized companies potentially face the future scaling and funding problem. Such companies may already be partially successful in their respective markets but further expansion financing for growth and internationalisation can come across the ‘bottleneck’ consequence. Much of the decline in the number of ‘smaller’ companies becoming listed is attributed to the very difficulty of being a small public company; this is reflected in the actions of venture capitalists, who once sought public listings when they wanted to exit their investments and now overwhelmingly choose private sales (Ritter, Economist, 2018 ). There is thus the real potential that firms are going to seek strategic alliances with incumbent financial institutions within the sector as their survival strategy. The risk for promising fintech/start-up companies is that there is also the potential to be constricted under the pressure of having to meet invariable demands in the services and products they offer. As such the issue becomes one of scale and capacity against larger firms, possibly the incumbents or indeed technology giants (i.e. Amazon, Apple etc.). This is important as at this stage. This is an industry with no ‘made’, crisis-resistant, proven businesses thus far. We do not know yet whether start-ups are mentally prepared for ‘exchanges’ in order to finance growth. In an industry under exponential development, pure cash exits do not exist as well for venture capital nor do acquisition evaluation models of a ‘made’ fintech business exist. Established institutions have the scale to absorb this which potentially gives rise to growth through a mergers and acquisitions wave. A pragmatic way for mergers to go through at this point is via exchanges of shares. The dangers in such a scenario are the ‘old-new firms’ where they ‘grow-and-consume’ entrants.","Global Fintech Investment Growth Continues in 2016 Driven by Europe and Asia, (2016); Agarwal, Sumit, Inconsistent regulators: Evidence from banking, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 129, 2, pp. 889-938, (2014); Complex Regulatory Landscape for Fintech an Uncertain Future for Small and Medium Sized Enterprise Lending, (2016); undefined, (2018); Allen, Franklin, Financial intermediaries and markets, Econometrica, 72, 4, pp. 1023-1061, (2004); Understanding Financial Crises, (2007); Allen, Franklin, Bubbles and crises, Economic Journal, 110, 460, pp. 236-255, (2000); Allen, Franklin, Financial contagion, Journal of Political Economy, 108, 1, pp. 1-33, (2000); Arner, Douglas W., FinTech, regTech, and the reconceptualization of financial regulation, Northwestern Journal of International Law and Business, 37, 3, pp. 373-415, (2017); Evolution of Fintech A New Post Crisis Paradigm, (2015)","","","Elsevier Inc.","","","","","","01486195","","JEBUD","","English","J.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly popular in the financial industry due to its ability to provide customers with cheap, efficient and personalised services. This article uses doctrinal sources and a case study to show that many banks and FinTech start-ups are investing in AI. Yet, there are a number of challenges arising from the use of AI which could undermine trust and confidence amongst consumers. This article features the issue of bias and discrimination in banking. There is evidence that algorithms discriminate against certain races and gender. Legislative gaps in the Equality Act 2010 and the General Data Protection Regime will be analysed. Ultimately, human beings are still needed to input, train and help machines to learn. Fortunately, the FCA are leading in regulating technology, from the launch of regulatory sandboxes to their co-operative collaboration with FinTech start-ups on regulatory matters.

The inflow of money from criminal activities has a destructive impact on the state and the society, poses a threat to the economy and the social sphere. This negative process results in the disruption of market economy mechanisms, the criminalization of the production and trade sectors, the emergence of financial imbalances and the increase in the inflation pressure. The problem is urgent for Russia as well, so the development of effective solutions, including legal ones, is one of the priorities for researchers. In the mod ern context, the digitization of economy creates new opportunities for criminal groups, who use virtual technologies, crypto-currencies and other opportunities of the digital environment to finance terrorism and legalize criminal proceeds. The article presents the results of studying the condition and dynamics of legal regulation in the sphere of CML / FT.

Their rapid spread requires the conception of a prevention model in order to deter its utilization in criminal activities and protect the users. This paper examines the technology of virtual currencies and studies its relevant characteristics from the standpoint of criminal law and criminology. The analysis emphasizes the risk increase it causes regarding highly complex criminal offenses, particularly money laundering. The paper criticizes the usage of conventional models for its regulation, and concludes with a new preventive regulatory approach that is consistent with the nature and modus operandi of this new technology. © 2018 Universidad de Chile.

With emerging research and innovation in data management solutions claiming assistance with various provisions of the GDPR, the task of comparing the degree and scope of such solutions is a challenge without a way to consolidate them. With GDPR as a linked data resource, it is possible to link together information and approaches addressing specific articles and thereby compare them. Organisations can take advantage of this by linking queries and results directly to the relevant text, thereby making it possible to record and measure their solutions for compliance towards specific obligations. GDPR text extensions (GDPRtEXT) uses the European Legislation Identifier (ELI) ontology published by the European Publications Office for exposing the GDPR as linked data. The dataset is published using DCAT and includes an online webpage with HTML id attributes for each article and its subpoints. A SKOS vocabulary is provided that links concepts with the relevant text in GDPR. To demonstrate how related legislations can be linked to highlight changes between them for reusing existing approaches, we provide a mapping from Data Protection Directive (DPD), which was the previous data protection law, to GDPR showing the nature of changes between the two legislations. We also discuss in brief the existing corpora of research that can benefit from the adoption of this resource. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","DCAT; DPD; e-governance; GDPR; Legal compliance; Linked resource; Regulatory technology; SKOS","Data privacy; Government data processing; Information management; Regulatory compliance; Semantic Web; DCAT; E-governance; GDPR; Legal compliance; Linked resource; SKOS; Linked data","","","","","Santa Fe Institute, SFI; Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, (13/RC/2106); Science Foundation Ireland, SFI; European Regional Development Fund, FEDER","Funding text 1: This paper is supported by the ADAPT Centre for Digital Content Technology, which is funded under the SFI Research Centres Programme (Grant 13/RC/2106) and is co-funded under the European Regional Development Fund.; Funding text 2: Acknowledgement.

(Semi-)automation of compliance processes requires a machine-readable version of legal requirements in a format that enables effective compliance assessment. The use of a semi-structured controlled natural language as an intermediate step of the translation from a human-readable text to a machine-readable and understandable format ensures that the process of interpretation of those requirements is as simple as possible. However, it does not ensure that the formal representation resulting from the interpretation faithfully represents the intended semantics provided by the legal expert. Visualization techniques such as property graphs in Neo4j could fill this gap, allowing legal experts to understand and control the formal representation of the result of their act of interpretation. © 2017 CEUR-WS.

This would be achieved by sharing certain elements of the dynamic transaction document on a bearer service, based on a federation of distribution ledgers; such a quasi-simultaneous sharing of risk data becomes possible because the dynamic transaction document maintain a record of state in semi-real time, and this state can be verified by anybody with access to the distribution ledgers, also in semi-real time. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the authors propose a novel, regular technology (RegTech) cum automated legal text approach for financial transaction as well as financial risk reporting that is based on cutting-edge distributed computing and decentralised data management technologies such as distributed ledger (Swanson, 2015), distributed storage (Arner et al., 2016; Chandra et al., 2013; Caron et al., 2014), algorithmic financial contract standards (Brammertz and Mendelowitz, 2014; Breymann and Mendelowitz, 2015; Braswell, 2016), automated legal text (Hazard and Haapio, 2017) and document engineering methods and techniques (Glushko and McGrath, 2005). This approach is equally inspired by the concept of the “bearer service” and its capacity to span over existing and future technological systems and substrates (Kavassalis et al., 2000; Clark, 1988). Findings: The result is a transformation of supervisors’ capacity to monitor risk in the financial system based on data which preserve informational content of financial instruments at the most granular level, in combination with a mathematically robust time stamping approach using blockchain technology. Practical implications: The RegTech approach has the potential to contain operational risk linked to inadequate handling of risk data and to rein in compliance cost of supervisory reporting. Originality value: The present RegTech approach to financial risk monitoring and supervisory reporting is the first integration of algorithmic financial data standards with blockchain functionality. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Algorithmic standards; Document engineering; RegTech; Smart contracts","","","","","","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur F&#x00F6;rderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF, (174853); Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur F&#x00F6;rderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF","","Acharya, Viral V., Caught between scylla and Charybdis?

Combining a review of the extant literature on high frequency trading with empirical data from interviews with financial traders, computer experts and regulators, we develop concepts of regulatory adaptation, technology asymmetry and market ambiguity to illustrate the 'dark art' of high frequency trading. Findings show high frequency trading is a multi-faceted, complex and secretive practice.

Thereby I mean to move beyond analyzing the shaping of technology within individual infrastructure projects and instead trace in a more encompassing way how dynamics at the institutional and policy level mediate the reorganization of disciplinary tool development. Drawing conceptual inspiration from the work of Sheila Jasanoff, I propose that digital infrastructure actually functions as a regulatory technology, i.e. as an interface through which the different actor groups (researchers, funders, policy makers) rearticulate their mutual relations. European initiatives, I argue, are based on a more centralizing, technology-driven vision of digital infrastructure that serves the European Commission’s policy goal of integrating national research systems in institutional and epistemic terms. This causes a certain disconnect between tool developers and prospective scholarly users who are often unfamiliar with digital approaches, but the emphasis on central coordination also ensures that no single community gains exclusive control over technology development. In the US, by contrast, the original impetus to adopt a concerted strategy for digital infrastructure has not been provided by science policy makers and administrators, but by researchers in the area of digital humanities. These scholars have successfully promoted a sociotechnical view of infrastructure as an emergent, evolutionary phenomenon, which also implies that conceptual and managerial authority should be situated at well-established digital humanities centers. While avoiding problems related to the implementation of technology in more traditional scholarly practices, this arrangement will tend to privilege the intellectual and technological preferences of existing elites within digital humanities over those of other research communities. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","cyberinfrastructure; digital humanities; digital infrastructure; European research area; humanities; infrastructure policy; regulatory technology","Computer applications; Computer science; Computer supported cooperative work; Digital humanities; Digital infrastructures; European Commission; European initiatives; Infrastructure project; Mutual relations; Research communities; Technology development; Decision making","","","","","","In order to contextualize the ACLS report’s vision of digital infrastructure, the dominant organizational format of digital scholarship in the US must be taken into account. Similar to the European context, efforts to coordinate digital scholarship on a larger scale predate the current debate on digital infrastructure. These efforts have largely been carried in campus-based digital humanities centers, which usually answer directly to their provost, and which have often originally been set up to serve the special ICT needs of faculty researchers (Clement and Reside ). An important difference to the European context is the pronounced divide between support staff and researchers in the US academic job system. Many now reputed digital scholars have started their careers in staff positions, thus preventing them early on from advancing in the professional hierarchy of traditional disciplines (Nyhan and Flinn ). At the same time, American DH centers are often funded through a combination of sources: A certain amount of base funding from the university; commercial revenues, e.g. from subscription fees for the use of digital archives; as well as moderate grant sums from federal, private, and philanthropic bodies. The diversity of funding sources constitutes a further important difference to the situation in many European countries, where digital scholarship is predominantly funded by a small number of public bodies and universities. According to a widespread organizational practice, various grants from these funding streams are pooled to create a number of stable, but locally defined professional functions within the center, for example a scholar-programmer and a scholar-web designer (Clement and Reside ). Through the creation of such a center-internal job ecology, digital humanists have often managed to combine service functions with a strong research component. For example, influential digital editions and database projects, such as the Blake Archive or the Brown Women Writers project, are research instruments to be used by other scholars, but also constitute acknowledged intellectual contributions to the body of scholarship in their own right. Networking among digital humanists in the US has been traditionally very strong, thus creating a quasi-disciplinary structure, yet without formal recognition in the shape of actual university departments. Many now prominent practitioners have spent formative years in a handful of influential institutions (such as IATH, or Brown University’s Scholarly Technology Group), from which they have then spread out to other parts of the country, often starting up centers of their own at their new alma mater.","New York Acls, (2006); Invitation to Tender, (2006); Anderson, Sheila, Methodological commons: Arts and humanities e-science fundamentals, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences, 368, 1925, pp. 3779-3796, (2010); D C NSF, (2003); Barjak, Franz, Case studies of e-infrastructure adoption, Social Science Computer Review, 27, 4, pp. 583-600, (2009); Barjak, Franz, The Emerging Governance of E-Infrastructure, Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 18, 2, pp. 1-24, (2013); Swindon Ahrc, (2006); Academic Tribes and Territories Intellectual Enquiry and the Cultures of Disciplines, (1989); Rescite the Blog of Noise, (2009); Scholarship in the Digital Age Information Infrastructure and the Internet, (2007)","W.

At the juncture of these phenomena lies regulatory technology or “RegTech”—the use of technology, particularly information technology, in the context of regulatory monitoring, reporting, and compliance. Regulating rapidly transforming financial systems requires increasing the use of and reliance on RegTech. Whilst the principal regulatory objectives (e.g., financial stability, prudential safety and soundness, consumer protection and market integrity, and market competition and development) remain, their means of application are increasingly inadequate. RegTech developments are leading towards a paradigm shift necessitating the reconceptualization of financial regulation.

While a few isolated suits might be successful in cases where there is provable fraud, such remedies are no general panacea for preventing large-scale bank-inflicted losses. Large losses are nearly always the result of unforeseeable or suddenly changing economic conditions, poor business judgment, or inadequate regulatory supervision-usually a combination of all three. Yet regulators face an increasingly complex task in supervising modern financial institutions. This Article explains how the challenge has become so difficult. It argues for preserving regulatory discretion rather than reducing it through formal congressional direction. The Article also asserts that regulators have to develop their own sophisticated methods of automated supervision. Although also not a panacea, the development of ""RegTech"" solutions will help clear away volumes of work that understaffed and underfunded regulators cannot keep up with. RegTech will not eliminate policy considerations, nor will it render regulatory decisions noncontroversial. Nevertheless, a sophisticated deployment of RegTech should help focus regulatory discretion and public-policy debate on the elements of regulation where choices really matter. © 2016 Lawrence G.

Yet, while computer code can enforce rules more efficiently than legal code, it also comes with a series of limitations, mostly because it is difficult to transpose the ambiguity and flexibility of legal rules into a formalized language which can be interpreted by a machine. With the advent of blockchain technology and associated smart contracts, code is assuming an even stronger role in regulating people's interactions over the Internet, as many contractual transactions get transposed into smart contract code. In this paper, we describe the shift from the traditional notion of ""code is law"" (i.e., code having the effect of law) to the new conception of ""law is code"" (i.e., law being defined as code).","","","","","","","Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (610961); Seventh Framework Programme, FP7; European Commission, EC; Ministerio de Educación, Cultura y Deporte, MECD, (CAS15/00203); Ministerio de Educación, Cultura y Deporte, MECD","This work was partially supported by the Framework programme FP7-ICT-2013-10 of the European Commission through project P2Pvalue (grant no.: 610961), and by the Spanish Ministry of Education's Jose Castillejo program for researcher mobility 2015 (ref.

Within 40 years the country went from a mono-bank model to one composed of hundreds of wholly-owned State banks and joint stock commercial banks. Yet this diversification has the banking landscape has not resolves credit allocation inefficiency. Indeed, whilst SME represent 80 % of the economic output of the country, it is only receiving 20 % of the credit originated by banks. This has spurred the development of shadow banking, an informal and unregulated network of lenders and borrowers. The emergence of Financial Technology has allowed for this activity digitized itself in the form of Peer-to-peer lending channel. The combination of and unregulated market and large credit gap has lead to the emergence of a sector that had only one platform in 2007 and over 2000 in 2015. Therefore the author submit that the emergence of the P2P sector in China is neither new, nor unexpected. Ultimately, this systemic shift caused by the P2P sector offers China a regulatory and market reform opportunity as the shadow has been brought to the light. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","China; Financial globalization; Financial innovation; Financial regulation; Financial technology; FinTech; RegTech; Regulatory technology","","","","","","","","Palgrave Macmillan Studies in Banking and Financial Institutions, (2011); Tsinghua China Law Review, (2015); China Development Bank Cdb and the China Exim Bank Ceb; Congressional Research Service Report, (2012); China A New Stage of Development for an Emerging Superpower, (2012); Arner, Douglas W., Financial stability, economic growth, and the role of law, Financial Stability, Economic Growth, and the Role of Law, pp. 1-344, (2007); Martin, Michael F., China's banking system: Issues for congress, China's Banking System, Currency Policy and Economic Conditions, pp. 1-62, (2012); Rise of the Peoples Bank of China the Politics of Institutional Change, (2013); A Crack in the Great Wall Too Big to Fail Them A Societal Perspective; Chinas Banking System Issues for Congress, (2012)","J.
