With a model of two-sided market with vertical restraints, we derive the following results. When only the entry of a vertically integrated (or end-to-end service) provider is allowed, either all merchants opt for multi-homing or no entry occurs, regardless of the regulatory requirement. On the other hand, if the entry of a downstream-only (or front-end service) provider is allowed, a partial multi-homing equilibrium could emerge under certain conditions, in which the entry of an end-to-end service provider does not occur. Without regulation, however, the vertically integrated incumbent does not voluntarily provide the back-end service to the entrant in general. This suggests the need for proper regulatory measures to reach a socially desirable outcome from the new entry in the retail payments market. © 2016 Korean Securities Association.",End-to-end; Entry; FinTech; Front-end; Retail payment,,,,"Boom in Global Fintech Investment A New Growth Opportunity for London Technical Report, (2014); Anderson, Ross J., The economics of information security, Science, 314, 5799, pp. 610-613, (2006); Armstrong, Mark, Competition in two-sided markets, RAND Journal of Economics, 37, 3, pp. 668-691, (2006); Journal of Law and Economics, (1983); Managing Information Risk and the Economics of Security, (2009); Banks New Competitors Starbucks Google and Alibaba Harvard Business Review Online, (2014); World Payments Report 2013 Technical Report, (2013); World Payments Report 2015 Technical Report, (2015); Choi, Jay Pil, Tying in two-sided markets with multi-homing, Journal of Industrial Economics, 58, 3, pp. 607-626, (2010); Non Banks in Retail Payments, (2014)","E.

Financial technologies (FinTech) have become an integral part of banking, and nowadays banks have started to compete beyond financial services facing increasing competition from nonfinancial institutions providing, for example, payment services. Start-up service providers, search engines, and social networks have expanded their services ""interfering"" in the fields traditionally covered by banks. The rapid rise of FinTech has changed the business landscape in banking asking for more innovative solutions. These recent tendencies require the banks to increase investment in FinTech, rethink service distribution channels, especially the business-to-consumers models, increase further standardization of backoffice functions, etc. Some members of the financial services industry see the boom in FinTech as a threat to traditional banking industry. Others believe that FinTech has become a challenge that can be turned into an opportunity as it provides more flexibility, better functionality in some areas, and aggregation of services. The aim of the paper is to analyze the recent trends in banking, identifying opportunities and risks of FinTech for banks. A timely integration of FinTech into business allows banks to get an advantage in growing competition. This paper provides an extensive analysis of recent trends in FinTech and banking, examining experience of leading European and US banks, as well as surveys conducted among members of the financial services industry in different countries. The authors have studied the development of the financial innovation and technology market, assessed the existing practices applied in the field of FinTech, identified the main risks related to development of FinTech and financial innovations the banks are exposed to on the micro- and macrolevel. The paper provides recommendations for regulators and banks to ensure reduction of risks associated with development of FinTech. Analysis of FinTech market has shown growing competition, including from nonfinancial institutions. The paper provides practical recommendations to commercial banks for strengthening the position in financial innovations and controlling the risks associated with introduction of financial innovations. © © 2017 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited all Rights of Reproduction in Any form Reserved.",Banking innovations; FinTech; Risks,,,,"undefined; undefined; Alt, Rainer, The rise of customer-oriented banking - Electronic markets are paving the way for change in the financial industry, Electronic Markets, 22, 4, pp. 203-215, (2012); Evolution of Fintech A New Post Crisis Paradigm, (2015); American Banker; Deutsche Bank Research, (2014); undefined; undefined, (2015); undefined; Kpmg",,,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.

This study aims to identify the strategic considerations in the process of searching for FinTech investment targets. Case description: This study used a case study investigation of a top-5 bank in Taiwan. The major data sources include the meeting notes of the FinTech investment task force and interviews with the team members. Co-opetition theory was adopted as the theoretical framework and interview questions were derived from the PARTS strategies in co-petition theory. The results relate to: (1) the strategic goals of FinTech investment, (2) the added value from FinTech companies, (3) criteria in selecting candidates in the same FinTech area, (4) choosing to work as either a cooperator or a competitor, and (5) barriers from policies and regulations. Discussion and evaluation: This study has several findings: (1) regulations and policies shape FinTech’s development; (2) banks, technology companies, and customers are not “FinTech ready;” (3) Compare top-down with bottom up strategies; (4) banks and FinTech companies have complex relationships; (5) it is unlikely that Taiwan will produce FinTech disruptors in the near future. Conclusion: The findings and discussion can benefit researchers and administrators in finance-related industries. More studies are desired to observe long-term development in terms of how companies collaborate or compete in specific FinTech areas. © 2016, The Author(s).",Bank 3.0; Co-opetition Theory; FinTech; Investment in FinTech; PARTS; Taiwan bank industry; Taiwan FinTech Industry,,Total,"• Financial Research and Data (79 startups, 824 M total funding)","Global Fintech Investment Growth Continues in 2016 Driven by Europe and Asia, (2016); Benbasat, Izak, The case research strategy in studies of information systems, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 11, 3, pp. 369-386, (1987); Co Opetition, (1996); Cavaye, Angèle L.M., Case study research: A multi-faceted research approach for IS, Information Systems Journal, 6, 3, pp. 227-242, (1996); Econ Res, (2011); Financial Supervisory Committee Big Data Project, (2015); Construct Digital Finance Environments, (2015); Act Governing Electronic Payment Institutions, (2015); Regulations of Bank and Financial Holding Company Investing Fintech Firms, (2015); Regulations of Industry of Information Service and Industry of Finance Technology Determined by the Competent Authority as Finance Related Industry, (2015)","J.-L.

In this article, we report the cash-based monetary practices of one Ethiopian rural community and identify their implications for the design of new financial technology. Particularly, we focus on addressing the question, What characteristic features should go into the design of mobile money application(s) to embody a rural Ethiopian community’s money practices in social (marriage and death) and religious contexts? Primary data on everyday practices of the community were collected. Analysis of our data reveals that new financial technology design should support lived experiences such as embedded social meaning, segregated and aggregate money control, restricted money use, identity extension and hiding, refusal and acceptance of donations, disclosed and secret money practices, and assigning aesthetics to money. The article concludes by discussing possible ways of mapping these concepts into financial system design, thus contributing toward the development of cashless transactions and a cashless society. © © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Human computer interaction; User interfaces; Ethiopia; Financial system; Primary data; Rural community; Technology designs; Ubiquitous technology; Finance,,,"Aaker, Jennifer Lynn, Why do people give?

In addition, it analyzed the causal relationship between concern for information privacy and self-efficacy by adopting them as moderating variables. Results suggested that usefulness, ease of use and credibility had an effect on intention to use, and self-efficacy was found to have an moderating effect on independent and dependent variables. Further, concern for information privacy was found to be a factor obstructing the path to intention to use. The implications of this study are that in the promotion of payment-type Fintech services, convenience and usefulness are the most critical and influential variables in terms of usage, while government deregulation and stronger security are called for from an institutional aspect. © Research India Publications.",Elaboration likelihood model; Fintech; K pay; Mobile payment service,,,,"Communication and Persuasion Central and Peripheral Routes to Attitude Change, (1986); Davis, Fred D., Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and user acceptance of information technology, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 13, 3, pp. 319-339, (1989); Financial Terminology Dictionary, (2015); Schierz, Paul Gerhardt, Understanding consumer acceptance of mobile payment services: An empirical analysis, Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 9, 3, pp. 209-216, (2010); Journal of Korean Association of Computer Education, (2015); Bhattacherjee, Anol, Influence processes for information technology acceptance: An elaboration likelihood model, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 30, 4, pp. 805-825, (2006); Korean Journal of Information Technology Services, (2015); Journal of Society for E Business Studies, (2011); Information Technology and Management, (2000); Information Systems Review, (2007)",,,Research India Publications subscription@ripublication.com,,,,,,09734562,,,English,Int.

FIDO services are adapting a variety of service areas such as easy payment, money transfer, ATM withdrawal/savings, and single sign-on, etc. Because FIDO service uses standard public key cryptography techniques to provide stronger authentication and securely saves a user's bio-information in the smartphone. But when registered, FIDO only confirms the match between pre-enrolled fingerprints and the one on the registration process. In other words, FIDO is not able to verify the person's identity. The user has to register his/her biometric information in each sites. It is our purpose to solve these problems by implementing FIDO and PKI technologies adapted in current FIDO service and accredited certification system. The proposed secure biometric authentication framework provides the centralized biometric authentication framework in Fintech environment that a variety of services need the interoperability of user's biometric information in order to protect user's privacy and increase convenience of customers. © 2016 SERSC.",Biometric authentication; FIDO(Fast Identity Online); PKI(Public Key Infrastructure),Authentication; Biometrics; Interoperability; Public key cryptography; Bioinformation; Biometric authentication; Biometric informations; Certification systems; FIDO(Fast Identity Online); Money transfers; Public key infrastructure; Registration process; Cryptography,,,"Kim, Yonghee, The adoption of mobile payment services for “fintech”, International Journal of Applied Engineering Research, 11, 2, pp. 1058-1061, (2016); International Journal of U and E Service Science and Technology, (2016); Stokkenes, Martin, Biometric authentication protocols on smartphones - An overview, ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, 20-22-July-2016, pp. 136-140, (2016); Passwordless Authentication Technology Fido, (2014); Datenschutz Und Datensicherheit Dud, (2014); Kim, Geonlyang, Secure user authentication based on the trusted platform for mobile devices, Eurasip Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking, 2016, 1, (2016); Thiemann, Todd, Picking the right path to mobile biometric authentication, Biometric Technology Today, 2016, 2, pp. 5-8, (2016); Fido Alliance, (2014); Kim, Jaejung, A study on the accredited certification system without password using FIDO(Fast identity online), International Journal of Applied Engineering Research, 10, 13, pp. 33617-33619, (2015); undefined",,,Science and Engineering Research Support Society ijbsbt@sersc.org,,,,,,17389976,,,English,Int.

This paper explores the complexity of Fintech, and attempts a definition, drawn from a process of reviewing more than 200 scholarly articles referencing the term Fintech and covering a period of more than 40 years. The objective of this study is to offer a definition which is distinct as well as succinct in its communication, yet sufficiently broad in its range of application. As the origins of the term can neither be unequivocally placed in academia nor in practice, the definition concentrates on extracting out the quintessence of Fintech using both spheres. Applying semantic analysis and building on the commonalities of 13 peerreviewed definitions of the term, it is concluded that Fintech is a new financial industry that applies technology to improve financial activities. The implications as well as the shortcomings of this definition are discussed. © 2021 Journal of Innovation Management.

Yet this diversification has the banking landscape has not resolves credit allocation inefficiency. Indeed, whilst SME represent 80 % of the economic output of the country, it is only receiving 20 % of the credit originated by banks. This has spurred the development of shadow banking, an informal and unregulated network of lenders and borrowers. The emergence of Financial Technology has allowed for this activity digitized itself in the form of Peer-to-peer lending channel. The combination of and unregulated market and large credit gap has lead to the emergence of a sector that had only one platform in 2007 and over 2000 in 2015.

The authors assume the general methodological approach of grounded theory to study four cases of financial technology platforms from Russia; the sample represents companies focusing both on solutions for the front end (consumers) and back end (middle of the value chain). The research finds that the top executives of the companies, which create and operate the digital platforms, have an approach to business strategy that is significantly different from that of the traditional business. They defy the pragmatism of predicting the market development and planning the company's actions in accordance with such predictions. Strategic paradigm of these companies is based on the notions of inclusivity, dynamism, and reliance on independent participants of a business ecosystem. Though a radical departure from the traditional business strategy, such an approach has brought demonstrable business success across the time span of a decade.

Crowdlending and Digital Advice offer additional opportunities for customers to manage their assets. In the banking market, “FinTechs” are the most notable example of what Schumpeter described as “creative destruction”. They could threaten the existence of established banks. Therefore the banks should use the FinTechs as a testing laboratory for customer behavior and testing ground for a more modern marketing policy. This environment gives rise to concerns that there may develop an unregulated area of shadow banks. But it should be considered that a level playing fi eld has to be ensured and that innovative processes and products are not stalled. A potential advantage of Digital Advice is that consumers can have the possibility to access the relevant information they need to make their fi nancial decisions. Consumers, in turn, are only able to benefi t from this advantage if competition between fi nancial service providers leads to a supply of clear and comprehensible information about fi nancial products and an appropriate degree of data security. The rise of Big Data analyses in retail banking allows a more precise estimation of creditworthiness risk as well as a consumer’s willingness-to-pay, propensity to switch and responsiveness to marketing offers. This not only impacts on competition, it represents major challenges for policymakers, authorities and consumers alike. © 2016 Springer Verlag.

Author John Waupsh is the Chief Innovation Officer at Kasasa, where he helps spearhead financial product development and implementation across hundreds of institutions. In this guide, he draws on more than a decade in the industry to offer clear, practical advice for competing with the megabanks, direct banks, non-banks, and financial technology companies. The discussion separates futurist thinking from today's realities, and dispels common myths surrounding the U.S. community banking model in order to shed light on the real challenges facing community banking institutions. It follows with clear solutions, proven strategies, and insight from experts across banking and fintech. All arguments are backed by massive amounts of data, and the companion website provides presentation-ready visualizations to help you kickstart change within your team. In the U.S. and around the globe, fintech companies and non-banks alike are creating streams of banking services that are interesting, elegant, and refreshing—and they're winning the hearts and minds of early adopters. Not a one-size-fits-all approach, this book offers many different tactics for community banks and credit unions to compete and flourish in the new world. • Analyze fintech's threat to the community banking model • Learn where community banking must improve to compete • Disprove the myths to uncover the real challenges banks face • Adopt proven strategies to bring your organization into the future Community banks and credit unions were once the go-to institutions for local relationship banking, but their asset share has been on the decline for three decades as the big banks just got bigger. Now, fintech companies are exploiting inefficiencies in the traditional banking model to streamline service and draw even more market share, as community banking executives are left at a loss for fresh tactics and forward-looking strategy.

But if user’s password is hacked in one insecure website, it is highly possible to get cracked in other sites as well, because the user usually uses the same passwords, allowing identity fraud, theft or massive data spill. As part of enhancing the security of password, user’s password is getting more difficult remember because it has requirements for the composition typically dictating minimum length and required special characters and numbers and so on. Therefore, it is our purpose to suggest biometric-based single sign-on system using FIDO that uses a suitable for FinTech by analyzing the challenges and problems of current password-based SSO system.

This book focuses on the role of technology in global finance and reflects on the ethical and societal meaning and impact of financial information and communication technologies (ICTs). Exploring the history, metaphysics, and geography of money, algorithms, and electronic currencies, the author argues that financial ICTs contribute to impersonal, disengaged, placeless, and objectifying relations, and that in the context of globalization these ‘distancing’ effects render it increasingly difficult to exercise and ascribe responsibility. Caught in the currents of capital, it seems that both experts and lay people have lost control and lack sufficient knowledge of what they are doing. There is too much epistemic, social, and moral distance. At the same time, the book also shows that these electronically mediated developments do not render global finance merely ‘virtual’, for its technological practices remain material and place–bound, and the ethical and social vulnerabilities they create are no less real. Moreover, understood in terms of technological practices, global finance remains human through and through, and there is no technological determinism. Therefore, Money Machines also examines the ways in which contemporary techno-financial developments can be resisted or re–oriented in a morally and socially responsible direction – not without, but with technology. As such, it will appeal to philosophers and scholars across the humanities and the social sciences with interests in science and technology, finance, ethics and questions of responsibility. © Mark Coeckelbergh 2015.

Author Paul Schulte, former economic analyst with the National Security Council, draws upon his own decade-spanning research to demonstrate how unethical banking practices provide the brute force that drives political and economic crises worldwide. By unbundling how credit markets work, this authoritative guide provides deep insight into crisis avoidance and detection, successful investment climates, and the groundwork that must be in place for policy makers to build a sound basis for economic growth. Clear, succinct case studies provide examples of policy and its effects on economic stability, giving you a stronger understanding of the network of forces that determine how loan/deposit ratios behave around the world. Countries that lend more than they save consistently get into trouble, with catastrophic consequences for the rich and middle class as well as the politicians. This book shows how credit excesses bring about price collapse in stocks, currencies, and real estate, and provides direction for change in the context of global economics. •Dive deep into the mechanisms underlying the credit markets •Learn how unregulated borrowing leads to socioeconomic crises •Examine real-world policy options through global case studies •Discover how credit rises are best detected and avoided An economic climate in which even the smallest hiccup can have long-lasting consequences should be the ideal impetus for a close scrutiny of global banking practices and economic policy. The Next Revolution in our Credit-Driven Economy takes you behind the scenes for a new perspective, and a more informed look at where the world needs to begin changing. The second half of the book will take a look at the revolution driving financial technology. Companies in Silicon Valley and giants like Alibaba are challenging the landscape for banking. This has profound implications for policy makers, banks and for a new class of entrepreneurs who are developing software which is taking away market share from bank and challenging decades-old financial empires. The book will explore the reasons why many global banks remain flat-footed. It will go into detail about the new companies and software that are moving in the Far East and with innovations in securities, bonds, foreign exchange, retail lending and SME lending. Lastly the book will look at the strategy behind Alibaba and how it will challenge many companies from a powerful base inside China. © 2015 by John Wiley & Sons Singapore Pte. Ltd.

In this enhancement program, the FSA recommended that regional financial institutions introduce new financial products such as collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) and collateralized bond obligations (CBOs). However, this was left up to each institution's discretion rather than being mandatory. This resulted in a large difference in the introduction of new products. Therefore, this article has analysed what kinds of credit associations favourably increased the use of new financial products. As a result, it has been confirmed that the larger their lending shares and management scale and the better their business conditions are, the more positively they work on the introduction of new products. Considering the fact that relationships between financial institutions and enterprises tend to be fixed in Japan, this means that medium and small enterprises will have restrictions on the financial products they can use depending on the situation of their main banks. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.",,credit provision; financial services; institutional framework; lending behavior; small and medium-sized enterprise; Japan,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS",This research is financially supported by the Grant-in-Aid from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (Kakenhi).,"Boot, Arnoud W.

The value of the asset lies in its transactional relations with other assets in the ecosystem or in other words being part of the architecture of related assets. It is argued that the deployment of financial trading software, as a product in brokerage houses in the emerging securities trading ecosystem in India by the software firm called Financial Technologies (FT), hastened institutionalization of new rules governing transactions embedded in the software design. As a result, FT implicitly collaborated with the regulator and other ecosystem participants who coordinated the innovation in design of the ecosystem. The software firm went on to expand the market for its own products (trading software) by incubating exchange ventures. This was achieved through a strategy of spawning of linked subsidiaries that led to both a growth of the trading ecosystem and further entrenchment of the innovated ecosystem. © 2010, IGI Global.",,,,,"On Poetic Imagination and Reverie, (1971); Biomedical Innovation in India with A Comparison to China and Others, (2008); Nasdaq A History of the Market that Changed the World, (2002); Interim Report of the Janakiraman Committee to Probe into the Securities Scam, (1992); Report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee to Probe into the Securities Scam of 1992, (1992); Lucas, Henry C., The defensive use of IT in a newly vulnerable market: The New York Stock Exchange, 1980-2007, Journal of Strategic Information Systems, 18, 1, pp. 3-15, (2009); Institutions Institutional Change and Economic Performance, (1990); Epw, (2006); Approach Paper on Implementation of STP in Indian Markets, (2002); Revised Scheme for Implementing Straight Through Processing in India, (2004)",,,IGI Global,,,,,,,9781615206094,,English,Cases on Technol.
