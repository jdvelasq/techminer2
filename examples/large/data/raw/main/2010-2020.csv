The rapid development of financial technology (fintech) is being responded quickly by many countries including Indonesia and Malaysia. Not only conventional fintech, but Sharia fintech is also developing significantly in both countries. This phenomenon is caused by the efficiency and ease of fintech. However, fintech in Indonesia is not followed by a comprehensive protection of personal data. The absence of special regulation on the protection of personal data in Indonesia causes the data often be misused by certain parties such as being stolen, sold, transferred and eliminated irresponsibly causing harm to fintech users. Meanwhile, Malaysia has built a legal system of personal data protection since 2010 and becomes the first country in the ASEAN region to have a comprehensive personal data protection law system. Therefore, the article aims to overview and compare the personal data protection law in Malaysia especially in fintech. To answer the problem, this study uses a normative-empirical method with a comparative law approach. The result of this article shows that Indonesia should learn from Malaysia by doing benchmarking as an effort to establish a comprehensive regulation for protecting personal data. A comprehensive regulation and law en-forcement on the protection of personal data are urgently needed in Indonesia to pro-tect the rights of fintech users. © Published by Faculty of Sharia, UIN Sulthan Thaha Saifuddin Jambi Mendalo Darat, Muaro Jambi, 36361, Indonesia.","Financial Technology; Malaysia and Indonesia; Personal Data","","","","","","","","International Journal of Law Government and Communication, (2019); Jurnal Manajemen Informatika Dan Teknik Komputer, (2017); Politik Hukum Pengaturan Perlindungan Data Pribadi Info Singkat Pusat Penelitian Badan Keahlian Dpr; Nurhasanah, The legal protection of sharia financial technology in Indonesia (Analysis of regulation, structure and law enforcement), International Journal of Advanced Science and Technology, 29, 3, pp. 3086-3097, (2020); Int J Acad Res Bus Soc Sci, (2024); Malaysia and Beyond K K Advocates Expert Panel Discussion on Data Protection, (2018); Jurnal Cakrawala Hukum, (2019); E Proceedings of the Conference on Management and Muamalah Comm, (2014); Diponegoro Law Journal, (2017); New Zealand Journal of Public and International Law, (2014)","","","State Islamic University of Sulthan Thaha Saifuddin Jambi","","","","","","1412436X","","","","English","AlRisalah.

The Government evaluates the prospects of development of artificial intelligence technology, blockchain, big data in the area of budget, tax, customs and other relations by now. However, the development of the FinTech in Russia faces many problems. First of all, these is the absence of digital infrastructure for mining cryptocurrency, issues related to information security, the potential risks of illegal non-personalized transactions through the blockchain technology. It is necessary to analyze the content of the discovered institutional problems and to determine the ways to resolve them. The significant role in overcoming the difficulties is assigned to the Federal Law ""About the Digital Financial Assets"", which shall enter into force on the 1st of January 2021.

This has caused a burst in credit and debit card fraud and has become a profoundly significant global issue. Fraud touches every area of our lives and is a growing concern that effects both businesses and customers. As machine learning techniques provide unique and efficient solutions, they are applicable in various types of problems. Recently, machine learning algorithms have been widely applied as a data mining technique for classification problems. In this paper, a binary classification problem is considered where a transaction can be classified as either fraudulent or legitimate transaction. The goal is to classify the transactions using five different machine learning algorithms. The transaction dataset (Task1 and Task2) is preprocessed, and then SGD, DT, RF, J48 and IBk machine learning classifiers are applied. After applying the classifiers, the results are compared to analyze which classifier performs the best. Based on the experimental results, it is found that the accuracy percentage of all the five classifiers for Task1 and Task2 datasets is ranging between 97.78% to 98.1%, with no major difference. As the dataset is highly imbalanced, the kappa statistic value is also considered. For both datasets, the RF classifier had the greatest value of kappa statistics, whereas SGD and J48 had the lowest value for Task1 and Task2, respectively. Other evaluation metrics were also considered for evaluating the performance of the applied classifiers. Overall, these classifiers achieved similar results for Task2 dataset. As negative Kappa statics and MCC values were obtained, the SGD classifier for Task2 dataset had the worst results in comparison. Based on evaluation criteria such as Kappa statistic and MCC values RF outperformed the others for both the datasets. © 2020 IEEE.","classification; credit and debit cards transactions; fraud detection; imbalanced data; ML algorithms","Classification (of information); Crime; Data mining; Fintech; Machine learning; Accuracy percentages; Binary classification problems; Evaluation criteria; Evaluation metrics; Fraudulent transactions; Kappa statistic; Machine learning techniques; Online transaction; Learning algorithms","","","","","","","Elements of Statistical Learning, (2001); Aaai Workshop on AI Approaches to Fraud Detection and Risk Management, (1997); Randhawa, Kuldeep Kaur, Credit Card Fraud Detection Using AdaBoost and Majority Voting, IEEE Access, 6, pp. 14277-14284, (2018); Raj, Benson Edwin, Analysis on credit card fraud detection methods, pp. 152-156, (2011); Proceedings of the 1st International Naiso Congress on Neuro Fuzzy Technologies, (2002); International Journal of Science and Research, (2016); Detecting credit card fraud using selected machine learning algorithms, pp. 1250-1255, (2019); International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing, (2019); Shift Credit Card Processing, (2020); Ghosh, Sushmito, Credit card fraud detection with a neural-network, Proceedings of the Hawaii International Conference on System Science, 3, pp. 621-630, (1994)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2020 International Conference on Innovation and Intelligence for Informatics, Computing and Technologies, 3ICT 2020","2020-12-20 through 2020-12-21","Sakheer","166447","","9781728196732","","","English","Int.

However, a global understanding of such innovations is limited, due to a lack of an underlying taxonomy and benchmark datasets in the FinTech domain. To address this limitation, we develop a FinTech taxonomy and manually annotate a set of FinTech patent abstracts according to the taxonomy. We use the annotated dataset to train deep learning models, specifically recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks combined with state-of-the-art BERT transformers. Experimental results show that the deep learning models can accurately identify FinTech innovations. We use our best performing BERT-based model on a large dataset of financial patent abstracts, and shortlist a set of 25,580 FinTech patent applications submitted to the European and US Patent Offices between 2000 and 2017. We illustrate how an analysis of the shortlisted set can be used to gain understanding of what FinTech innovations are, where and when they emerge, and provide the basis for further work on what their impact is on the companies investing in them, and ultimately on society. © 2020 IEEE.","BERT; Deep Learning; Financial Technologies; FinTech; Patent Classification","Abstracting; Convolutional neural networks; Large dataset; Learning systems; Recurrent neural networks; Taxonomies; Annotated datasets; Benchmark datasets; BERT; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Financial technology; Large datasets; Learning models; Patent classifications; State of the art; Patents and inventions","","","","","","","Arner, Douglas W., FinTech, regTech, and the reconceptualization of financial regulation, Northwestern Journal of International Law and Business, 37, 3, pp. 373-415, (2017); Wójcik, Dariusz, Conclusions: A global overview from a geographical perspective, pp. 207-231, (2018); Tech Determinants of Fintech Start Up Emergence and Innovation in the Financial Services Incumbent Sector, (2019); Chen, Mark A., How Valuable Is FinTech Innovation?, Review of Financial Studies, 32, 5, pp. 2062-2106, (2019); Bert Pre Training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding, (2018); Gomber, Peter, Digital Finance and FinTech: current research and future research directions, Journal of Business Economics, 87, 5, pp. 537-580, (2017); Goldstein, Itay, To FinTech and beyond, Review of Financial Studies, 32, 5, pp. 1647-1661, (2019); Financial Information Systems and the Fintech Revolution, (2018); ACM SIGIR Forum, (2003); Current Challenges in Patent Information Retrieval, (2011)","","Wu, X.; Jermaine, C.; Xiong, L.; Hu, X.T.; Kotevska, O.; Lu, S.; Xu, W.; Aluru, S.; Zhai, C.; Al-Masri, E.; Chen, Z.; Saltz, J.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Ankura TM; IBM; IEEE; IEEE Computer Society","8th IEEE International Conference on Big Data, Big Data 2020","2020-12-10 through 2020-12-13","Virtual, Online","168025","","9781728162515","","","English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

However, due to limited capital, the background of the birth of legal entities from the government to the private sector offered a program to lend money which was then used for capital. In the process, this loan is often called a credit agreement in which the minimum requirement is a guarantee that will later be used as a collateral object. The guarantee acts as an addition (accesoir) to the main agreement which is to convince the creditor of the assets of the debtor and their ability to make payments later. Because not everyone has sufficient assets to make a loan, a guarantee institution arises that provides a loan program without using collateral. In connection with the development of technology, a new program was born, namely peer to peer lending based on financial technology. Ease in requirements and track record written in a system is the attraction of this type of loan, but because it is regulated by the system, there can be a mismatch of what is promised. © 2020, Faculty of Law, Universitas Muslim Indonesia.

This study broadly classified these sub-constructs in three dimensions: adoption, behavior and technological and explores the relationship between these attributes. It also proposes that digital behavior (Internet experience and level of awareness) and demographic characteristics (age and gender) moderate the main relationships. Design/methodology/approach: The measurement scale for the study is developed through iterative discussion with domain experts. The data are collected from 439 active Internet users though a digital survey and analysis were done by applying structural equation modeling and multi-group analysis. Findings: Perceived usefulness and social influence are found to be the key determinant for behavior intention to use FinTech services, with social influence having significant negative influence. Actual use is significantly influenced by ease of use and social influence but is not determined by behavior intention and perceived usefulness. Behavioral attributes are significantly impacted by technological attributes and digital behavior. Also, age significantly affects the perception of security among older users. Practical implications: This study will help FinTech service providers to design FinTech services considering a wide spectrum of users. More consideration should be on enhancing the usefulness and security features to create social affirmations for the use of FinTech services. This will entice users for frequent use and attract nonusers to do their first online financial transaction. Originality/value: The study adds to the technology acceptance literature by incorporating relevant technological and behavioral attributes and investigating the moderating effect of digital behavior and demographic characteristics. It contributes to the understanding of user beliefs and perceptions about actual use of FinTech services. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adoption drivers; FinTech service; ServPerf; TAM; Technology adoption; UTAUT; WebQUal 4.0","","","","","","","","Impact of Digital Financial Services on Firm S Performance A Literature Review, (2017); Abu-Shanab, Emad Ahmed, Internet banking in Jordan: The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) perspective, Journal of Systems and Information Technology, 9, 1, pp. 78-97, (2007); Adams, Dennis A., Perceived usefulness, ease of use, and usage of information technology: A replication, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 16, 2, pp. 227-247, (1992); Action Control from Cognition to Behavior, (1985); Ajzen, Icek, The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); Abdallah Alalwan, Ali Abdallah, Factors influencing adoption of mobile banking by Jordanian bank customers: Extending UTAUT2 with trust, International Journal of Information Management, 37, 3, pp. 99-110, (2017); Amin, Hanudin, An analysis of mobile credit card usage intentions, Information Management and Computer Security, 15, 4, pp. 260-269, (2007); Journal of Electronic Commerce Research, (2002); Birch, A., Preservice teachers’ acceptance of ICT integration in the classroom: Applying the UTAUT model, Educational Media International, 46, 4, pp. 295-315, (2009); Kasetsart Journal of Social Sciences, (2017)","S.

Particularly, the purpose is to identify a benchmark profile of CEOs and to understand which are the main features (e.g. age, tenure, education specification, education level, gender, nationality, years of entrepreneurship, years in financial functions, years in IT functions), giving more opportunity to develop and maintain sustainable business models using innovative platforms. Design/methodology/approach: The research questions are answered through a quali-quantitative methodology using descriptive and statistical approaches. The researchers collected a sample of 100 Fintech firms from the main Fintech firms in 2018 identified by the annual KPMG Report (2019). Thus, the research observed and tested the average level of the major CEO demographic features. Additionally, the paper explored whether these variables have a major probability to affect Fintech leading. Findings: Assuming a relevant part of Fintech firms, the main results of this paper show the relevance of several CEO demographic characteristics. Additionally, the age, the tenure and the presence of an MBA are significant elements in affecting Leading companies. Originality/value: The paper is novel because it contributes to the literature examining the internal governance and sustainable business model, still not explored.

While both concepts have been researched in recent years, their intersection, often conceived as “green FinTech,” remains under‐determined. Therefore, this paper contributes to this important discussion about green FinTech by, first, synthesizing the relevant literature systematically. Second, it shows the results of an empirical, in-depth analysis of the Swiss FinTech landscape both in terms of green FinTech startups as well as the services offered by the incumbents. The research results show that literature in this new domain has only emerged recently, is mostly characterized by a specific focus on isolated aspects of green FinTech and does not provide a comprehensive perspective on the topic yet. In addition, the results from the literature and the market analysis indicate that green FinTech has an impact along the whole value chain of financial services covering customer‐to‐customer (c2c), business‐to‐customer (b2c), and business‐to‐business (b2b) services. Today the field is predominantly captured by startup companies in contrast to the incumbents whose solutions are still rare. © 2020 by the authors.

The fintech concept that adapts to technological developments is expected to facilitate a more practical, secure, and modern financial transaction process, including digital-based financial services that are currently developing around the world. The implementation of fintech in Indonesia is divided into conventional fintech and sharia fintech which provides choices for the public in accessing financial services. The problem comes from the Muslim community who still do not believe in the implementation of the Islamic financial industry especially sharia fintech. The existence of skepticism from the community is the basis of this research. This research uses normative legal research methods to describe and explaining efforts to implement sharia fintech in protecting the consumers, especially the protection of “spiritual rights”. This protection can be pursued through the spread of sharia principles in which sharia fintech financing services do not contain usury, uncertainty (ghoror), speculation (masyir), hiding damage (tadlis), harming other parties (dharar), and avoiding illegal matters (haram). Then the implementation of sharia fintech in protecting the customer’s spiritual rights can also be pursued by applying financing arrangements that have been regulated by applicable regulations and by Fatwa DSN-MUI, such as contract/akad al-bai’, akad ijarah, akad mudharabah, akad musyarakah, akad wakalah bi al ujrah, and akad qardh. © 2020, Mataram University Faculty of Law.

Spe- cifically, in their capacity as settlement agencies and operators of their national RTGS systems, many central banks are today considering the merits of extending RTGS access to retail payment service providers (PSPs) other than commercial banks, to include emerging companies that apply technology to the provision of payment or payment-related services. This paper frames the issue within the broader context of whether, and to what extent, access to RTGS systems should be extended to non-bank PSPs. Decades of experience with RTGS systems across countries in different stages of financial sector development, in an increasingly globalised marketplace, have revealed a number of practical problems for central banks, the direct users of RTGS systems, and other beneficiaries of their services. This paper draws on such experience and practice. The paper ends by submitting a few con- siderations on how RTGS access issues relate to central bank digital currencies. © Henry Stewart Publications, 1750-1806.","Access; FinTech; Non-bank payment service providers; RTGS","","","","","","","","Remarks at the Forum Towards Making Effective Use of the Boj Net, (2017); Role of Central Bank Money in Payment Systems, (2003); Global Payment System Survey 2018, (2018); Non Banks in Retail Payments, (2014); Core Principles for Systemically Important Payment Systems, (2001); Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures Pfmis are the International Standards for Financial Market Infrastructures Ie Payment Systems Central Securities Depositories Securities Settlement Systems Central Counterparties and Trade Repositories, (2014); Banco De Mexico Reserves the Right to Grant Access to the System to Any Other Entity Provided that this is Regulated and Supervised by Banco De Mexico Itself the Comisionnacional Bancaria Y De Valores the Nacional Del Sistema De Ahorro Para El Retiro or the Nacional De Seguros Y Finanzas the Prospective Participant Must Demonstrate that It Complies with the Technical Requirements to Operate in Spei; Telecomm A Public Telecommunication Firm that Provides Remittance and Bank Agent Services Mostly in Remote Villages Was Granted Direct Access to Spei, (2010); undefined; Reform of Australias Payments System Issues for the 2007 08 Review, (2007)","","","Henry Stewart Publications","","","","","","17501806","","","","English","J.

However, with the change of loan model and the rise of financial technology, existing approaches to credit rating are facing challenges. Therefore, how to improve existing approaches to credit rating has become an important research issue. In this paper, we study the issue of applying social analytics to credit rating. Using Facebook as the data source, we adopt the CART decision tree deduction to analyze social media data of tested users and compare our result of analysis with that of existing approaches.Our study shows that those who have better credit rating also possess certain common characteristics in their social media data. In addition, the application of social analytics can complement existing approaches to credit rating. Our research results can not only be used as an auxiliary to existing approaches, but also be used by the lender to strengthen the risk assessment of the borrower. The proposed approach can increase the flexibility on the amount and interest rate of loans, so as to improve the overall performance of loans. © 2020 IEEE.","Credit Rating; Decision Tree Deduction; Financial Technology; Social Analytics","Decision trees; Fintech; Risk assessment; Social networking (online); Trees (mathematics); Credit ratings; Data-source; Facebook; Interest rates; Research issues; Research results; Social media datum; Rating","","","","","","","Adali, Sibel, Predicting personality with social behavior, pp. 302-309, (2012); Breiman, Leo, Classification and regression trees, pp. 1-358, (2017); Frydman, Halina, Credit rating dynamics and Markov mixture models, Journal of Banking and Finance, 32, 6, pp. 1062-1075, (2008); Handbook of Personality Theory and Research, (1999); Sherman, Ryne A., Properties of persons and situations related to overall and distinctive personality-behavior congruence, Journal of Research in Personality, 46, 1, pp. 87-101, (2012); undefined","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Cisco; et al.; Fortinet; Logicalis Architects of Change; NARLabs - National Center for High-Performance Computing (NCHC); NetApp","2020 International Computer Symposium, ICS 2020","2020-12-17 through 2020-12-19","Tainan","167420","","9781728192550","","","English","Proc. - Int.

The development of digital transformation has also clearly triggered the emergence of fintech (financial technology) initiatives, which are recognized as some of the most important innovations in the financial industry. These initiatives are developing rapidly, driven in part by the sharing economy, regulations, and information technology. However, research in the field of fintech remains in its infancy. Fintech offers several services, such as funding, payment (including electronic wallets), e-aggregators, e-trading, and e-insurance, and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. This provides an opportunity to more closely examine fintech’s research challenges and trends. This study aims to (1) determine the state of the art of financial technology research; (2) identify gaps in the financial technology research field; and (3) identify challenges and trends for future research potential. The novel proposal in this study includes theoretical contributions regarding financial technology. Using the systematic literature review approach of Kitchenham, in addition to thematic analysis, meta-analysis and observation to validate the quality of literature and analysis, the results of this study provide a theoretical basis fintech research from an information systems perspective, including the formulation of fintech technology concepts and their development. © 2020 by the authors.

The purpose of this study is to provide comprehensive data and evidence on value of the FinTech innovation event. First, a text-based filtering method for identifying FinTech patent applications is provided. Using machine learning applications, innovations are classified into major technology groups. The methodology for valuation of FinTech innovation is based on data of stock price changes. To assess the value impact, Poisson flow rates and stock price movements were combined. Further, to evaluate the effect of FinTech patents on the company's value, a combination of CAR of patent application and Poisson intensities were used. Research findings provide evidence that FinTech innovations bring significant value for innovators and Blockchain being especially valuable. Such innovations as blockchain, robo-advising and mobile transactions are the most valuable for the financial sector. On one side of the spectrum, the financial industry can be affected more negatively by the innovation of nonfinancial startups that carry disruptive technology at their core. However, on the other side of the spectrum, market leaders who make significant investments in their innovations can evade most of these negative effects. This helped to form an overall view of FinTech innovations. © 2020 by the authors.

The research empirically examines the factors affecting Jordanian citizens’ intention to use FinTech applications. The sample of the research comprised 500 potential FinTech service users in Jordan. Based on the research conceptual model, five hypotheses were developed and tested using structural equation modeling techniques (SEM-PLS). The research results indicate that perceived benefits and social norms significantly affect the intention to use FinTech applications. However, it has been found that perceived technology risks do not significantly affect the intention to use FinTech applications. Moreover, the results also indicate that customer trust is significantly mediating the relationship between perceived risks and intention to use FinTech applications. FinTech service providers should insure that their products are easy to use, fulfill needs and protect consumers’ data in order to ensure trust, hence positively influencing consumer adoption. © 2020 by the author.

Though fintech innovations are touted as game changers in deepening financial inclusion, their wide acceptance and use still remain limited. In the extant literature, technological and behavioural antecedents that influence users’ behaviour toward financial technologies are not fully understood. This study argues that understanding antecedents to the actual use of fintech innovations will lead to deepening financial inclusion. Using mobile money—a type of fintech innovation, this study adopts the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) and the Prospect theory. Drawing on survey data collected from 294 respondents, this study applies the partial least square structural equation modelling technique. The findings show that performance and effort expectancy have significant relationship with the intention to use mobile money services. However, contrary to well-established positions, price value, hedonic motivation, social influence and perceived risk do not influence intention and use of mobile money services. The study makes significant theoretical contributions and offers practical and policy implications for deepening financial inclusion. © 2020","Antecedents; Financial inclusion; FinTech; Mobile money; Prospect theory; SEM; UTAUT2","Electronic money; Public policy; Surveys; Financial inclusions; Financial service; Hedonic motivations; Intention to use; Partial least square (PLS); Policy implications; Structural equation modelling; Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology; Fintech","","","","","","","Abdullahi Abubakar, Yazid Abdullahi, What specific modes of internationalization influence SME innovation in Sub-Saharan least developed countries (LDCs)?, Technovation, 79, pp. 56-70, (2019); Ajzen, Icek, Residual Effects of Past on Later Behavior: Habituation and Reasoned Action Perspectives, Personality and Social Psychology Review, 6, 2, pp. 107-122, (2002); Akomea-Frimpong, Isaac, Control of fraud on mobile money services in Ghana: an exploratory study, Journal of Money Laundering Control, 22, 2, pp. 300-317, (2019); Aquino Shluzas, Lauren M., The insight-value-perception (iVP) model for user-centered design, Technovation, 34, 11, pp. 649-662, (2014); Simplice, Asongu Anutechia, The role of governance in mobile phones for inclusive human development in Sub-Saharan Africa, Technovation, 55-56, pp. 1-13, (2016); Baganzi, Ronald, Examining trust and risk in mobile money acceptance in Uganda, Sustainability (Switzerland), 9, 12, (2017); Technology Studies, (1995); Baudier, Patricia, Smart home: Highly-educated students' acceptance, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 153, (2020); Chauhan, Sumedha, Acceptance of mobile money by poor citizens of India: Integrating trust into the technology acceptance model, Info, 17, 3, pp. 58-68, (2015); Chen, Ke, Predictors of gerontechnology acceptance by older Hong Kong Chinese, Technovation, 34, 2, pp. 126-135, (2014)","P.K.

Risk management is consider both compliance and sustainability. Moreover, FinTech is considered for financial industry and related with e-transaction or e-payment industries as well. There are certain standards (ISO31000:2018 and ISO27005:2018) and fundamentally applied in information technology; however, it renders insufficient for the newer technologies. In order to determine and assess the potential risks associated with FinTech. Our finding are business and technology risks which are related to FinTech. These two clusters are validated by qualitative and quantitative method. This study combines a known set of FinTech risks with data obtained through the consensus process. I-CVIs and K-mean clustering algorithm are the tools for data analysis on this paper. It has been found that the technologies themselves are at risks of 0.3 and the business risks are at 0.7. The study indicate that traditional technology risks have relevant. The difference in the levels of risks depends on the details of each FinTech type and the parts of the business which technologies are associated with.

As a result, firms have used cellular phones, the Internet, and digital currencies to facilitate exchanges and operate their businesses. This course of action affects the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. The goal of the present study is to examine the role that fintech plays in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. First, we analyse the income velocity and the money multiplier during pre-fintech and post-fintech periods. The results confirm that there is no change in income velocity and the money multiplier during these periods. Second, we develop the money demand function to examine the effect of monetary policy and demonstrate that low monetary policy rates lead to an increase in money demand. When we introduce fintech components to examine their impact on money demand, we find that mobile and Internet technologies and all digital currencies considered in this study are robust predictors of money demand. Third, we analyse the product market equation and report that after the initiation of fintech, monetary policy has a significant effect. To examine the cost function, we incorporate fintech components and identify that cellular phones, Internet technology, Litecoin, and Ethereum are the determinants of the output gap. Finally, we examine the drivers of fintech and determine that the real interest rate, GDP, inflation, the financial development index, and stock market indices are significant determinants of fintech. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","","demand analysis; financial market; financial services; income; innovation; monetary policy","","","","","","","Arize, Augustine Chuck, Effects of Financial Innovations on the Money Demand Function: Evidence From Japan, International Economic Journal, 4, 1, pp. 59-70, (1990); Arrau, Patricio, Financial innovation and money demand: application to Chile and Mexico, Review of Economics and Statistics, 75, 3, pp. 524-530, (1993); American Economic Review, (1988); Braun, Benjamin, Speaking to the people?

While the adoption of FinTech appears to be widely regarded as a strategic priority for financial institutions worldwide, the empirical evidence on the managerial challenges under FinTech is very scant, especially from the perspective of developing countries. With this in mind, this chapter aims at providing empirical evidence on the managerial challenges emanating from FinTech within the context of Zimbabwean commercial banks. The study establishes seven challenges, namely, customer retention, regulatory compliance, technology risk, increased competition, cyber-attacks, the inadequacy of IT employees, and system downtimes.

Some scholars regard ""FinTech"" as financial innovations that upset the market while others view them as startups, based on financial innovations, that have changed the ecosystem. There are many open-ended questions about FinTech's business models, how it relates to blockchain, and whether this is a collaborative relationship between traditional financial players or a competitive relationship. Noting the lack of research work on these themes, this book attempts to shed light on this area to bridge the gap between the discourse of practitioners and the literature. Influence of FinTech on Management Transformation is an innovative reference book that defines FinTech and its ecosystem as well as concepts in relation to management transformations caused by FinTech and shares new theoretical and empirical frameworks, useful experiences, and best practices to deal with new technological changes. The chapters are divided into three interrelated sections: ""Insights From the Blockchain Technology""; ""Managerial and Cultural Transformations in the Era of FinTech""; and ""Empirical Experiences and Applications."" This book is a valuable reference tool for financial planners/advisors, managers, accountants, financial analysts, compliance experts, practitioners, researchers, academicians, and students interested in the influence of FinTech on management transformation. © 2021 by IGI Global.

The choice is disruption or collaboration. This study investigates the antecedents of fintech collaboration based on leadership styles and its consequence on competitive advantage. The study is a quantitative causality approach using a questionnaire to collect the data and use structural equation modelling to analyse it. There are 166 respondents, as samples, from 479 supervisors to directors of automotive, electronics, and food and beverage of medium and large companies. Results show that leadership styles have a positive effect on competitive advantage and fintech collaboration. This study's original value is that fintech collaboration is a necessity for managerial decisions as a mediator for competitive advantage based on leadership styles. It concludes that the primary antecedent choice in encouraging fintech collaboration is transactional leadership, and collaboration with the fintech entity to create a competitive advantage is necessary. Meanwhile, for further research, it is assumed that suitable leadership to encourage competitive advantage through fintech is transformational leadership, and collaborate with the fintech entity is a must. © The Author (s) 2020","Competitive Advantage; Fintech Collaboration; Leadership Styles","","","","","","","The authors would like to thank the Ministry of Research and Technology / National Research and Innovation Agency of the Republic of Indonesia, who has provided grant funds for the multi-year research of this ""Fundamental Research"" scheme in 2020.","International Journal of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, (2017); African Journal of Business Management, (2015); Anning-Dorson, Thomas, Innovation and competitive advantage creation: The role of organisational leadership in service firms from emerging markets, International Marketing Review, 35, 4, pp. 580-600, (2018); Barney, Jay Bryan, The resource-based view of the firm: Ten years after 1991, Journal of Management, 27, 6, pp. 625-641, (2001); Bibby, Lee, Defining and assessing industry 4.0 maturity levels–case of the defence sector, Production Planning and Control, 29, 12, pp. 1030-1043, (2018); Bonilla, Silvia H., Industry 4.0 and sustainability implications: A scenario-based analysis of the impacts and challenges, Sustainability (Switzerland), 10, 10, (2018); Journal of Progressive Research in Social Sciences, (2015); Donate, Mario J., The role of knowledge-oriented leadership in knowledge management practices and innovation, Journal of Business Research, 68, 2, pp. 360-370, (2015); Fintech in Germany, (2017); Journal of Developing Areas, (2017)","S.

The results of the study conclude that the Sharia Supervisory Board is one of the main forms of sharia compliance in every Islamic financial industry including in Sharia Fintech to comply with sharia provisions which make sharia supervision an integral part of sharia compliance. The presence of the Sharia Supervisory Board poses the challenge of limited human resources who are experts in the field of Islamic economics, as well as the assumption that the Sharia Supervisory Board is only a complementary object whose role is not too important.

In the wake of fintech as a new trend in financial markets, the ground-breaking book stressed the relevance of Islamic finance and its implications, when enabled by fintech, towards the development of the Islamic digital economy. While the earlier work discussed the crucial innovation, structural, and institutional development for financial technologies in Islamic Finance, this new research explores the multiple applications possible in the various sectors of the economy, within and beyond finance, that can be significantly transformed. These revolutionary applications involve the integration of AI, blockchain, data analytics, and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices for a holistic solution to tackle the bottlenecks and other issues in existing processes of traditional systems. The principles of accountability, duty, justice, and transparency are the foundation of shaping the framework in achieving good governance in all institutions — public or private, Islamic or otherwise. Technologies like AI, blockchain, and IoT devices can operationalize the transparency and accountability that is required to eradicate poverty, distribute wealth, enhance micro-, small- and large-scale initiatives for social and economic development, and thus share prosperity for a moral system that enables a more secure and sustainable economy. © 2021 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

This study therefore assesses both the probability and actual rates of fintech adoption in 32 African economies between 2002 and 2018. Based on the information spill-over and rank theories, multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the average probability of fintech adoption for all, emerging and frontier African economies to be 50.9%, 83.1%, and 23.1%, respectively, whereas the actual rates are 27%, 40%, and 29%, respectively. The fragile economies, however, had no reasonable probability or actual rates of fintech adoption. Further, odds ratios of 1 or more- suggest a one-unit change in the predicators will exert no impact on these rates. Thus, it is concluded that emerging economies and mobile phone banking drive fintech adoption in Africa, and is largely dependent mainly on structural changes rather than economic and financial factors. The current study consequently recommends improved literacy, ICT training, and structural changes to promote fintech across the continent. © 2020 AESS Publications.

Building on the resource-based view of entrepreneurship, we reveal the determinants of performance of FinTech, high-tech companies in the financial area. Cross-sectional regression models are used on a dataset of 100 FinTechs in Russia. The performance of FinTechs is measured by year-on-year growth in revenues and assets during 2016-2018 and return on assets. The results show that FinTechs, having status Skolkovo members, perform better than other FinTechs. The results are valid for ROA and growth in revenues. Moreover, the growth of assets is lower for FinTechs, founded in Moscow. FinTechs, financed by own resources, perform better than other FinTechs. It can be explained by the peculiarities of the financing market in Russia. Also timely and prompt repayment of debts has a positive effect on FinTechs performance. FinTechs, having current liquidity ratio lower, perform better than other FinTechs.

Although many experts believe that in the confrontation between banks and fintech companies, banks are surrendering their competitive positions in the financial market to fintech companies, the article provides facts proving the opposite. The purpose of the study is to assess the competitive position of banks in comparison with fintech companies. The study used a systematic approach, comparative analysis, expert estimates, logical analysis. The article recognizes the fact that there are new competitors in the financial market. However, fintech companies are ahead of banks exclusively in technology, expanding the delivery channels of banking products to customers. The product line of banks is much larger than that of fintech companies. Banks, with the skills and experience of a highly professional banking business, have begun digital transformation. Today banks are transferring their business to new modern technologies. Banking leaders are becoming leaders among all financial market players. This is especially noticeable in Russia, where the largest bank, the Savings Bank of Russia, has officially announced a change in its business model. The Sber ecosystem, he created, marked the beginning of the transition to the next stage in the development of the fintech area. Summarizing the results of the study, the authors of this article proved that universal banks remain the leaders in the Russian financial market both in terms of product line and digital technologies, Russian banks began to develop the non-banking services sector and create integrated ecosystems. Also, the authors substantiated the onset of the era of fintech 4.0, identifying signs that allow making this conclusion. © 2020 ACM.","bank; bank ecosystem; banking products and services; competition; fintech; fintech companies; High-tech companies; neobank","Banking; Commerce; Ecosystems; Financial markets; Manufacture; Service industry; Comparative analysis; Competitive position; Delivery channels; Digital technologies; Digital transformation; Financial institution; Identifying signs; Modern technologies; Fintech","","","","","","","undefined; undefined; undefined; undefined; Revesco Rev Estud Coop, (2025); Zvieriakov, M.

The purpose of the work is to determine the need to transform the traditional business of financial companies into fintech in order to maintain the competitiveness of companies in the market. A brief overview of theoretical and empirical studies of the implementation of modern information and other technologies in the financial (primarily banking and insurance) sphere is presented. The international experience of the development of fintech companies with the volume of investments in financial technologies on a global scale is considered. The financial technologies that have received the greatest development in Russia at the present stage of expansion of the activities of fintech companies are presented. The tendencies contributing to the rapid introduction of financial technologies in the public life of the country's citizens are highlighted. The obvious advantages of fintech companies over traditional financial companies are noted, which is reflected in the differences in the development of these firms in the last decade. The result of the study was the identification of areas of financial business in which fintech is able to oust traditional financial companies from the market, which are unable to develop within the framework of the trend for the introduction of financial technologies. The study convincingly showed that the financial sector of the economy is rapidly changing, transforming into financial and technological companies that are more competitive through the introduction of modern technologies and focus on a wide range of consumers of services. © 2020 ACM.","Blockchain; Competitiveness; Digital ecosystem; Fintech; Tech companies","Commerce; Competition; Investments; Manufacture; Service industry; Empirical studies; Financial companies; Financial sectors; Global scale; International experiences; Modern technologies; Present stage; Production process; Fintech","","","","","","","Global Fintech Adoption Index 2019, (2025); How Banks can Unleash the Potential of Fintech; undefined; Evolution of Fintech A New Post Crisis Paradigm, (2015); Goldstein, Itay, To FinTech and beyond, Review of Financial Studies, 32, 5, pp. 1647-1661, (2019); Fintech and the Remaking of Financial Institutions; Handbook of Blockchain Digital Finance and Inclusion; Fast Moving World of Fintech is Now A Fast Growing Research Topic; Soloviev, Vladimir I., Fintech ecosystem and landscape in Russia, Journal of Reviews on Global Economics, 7, Special Issue, pp. 377-390, (2018); Fintech in the Banking System of Russia Problems and Prospects","","","Association for Computing Machinery","","2020 International Scientific Conference on Digital Transformation on Manufacturing, Infrastructure and Service, DTMIS 2020","2020-11-18 through 2020-11-19","Saint - Petersburg","169044","21531633","9781450377881; 9781450385855; 9781450314398; 9781450396387; 9781450390019; 9781450390217; 9781450348270; 9781450381963; 9781450322485; 9781450348201","","","English","ACM Int.

As a result, organizations are seeking ways in the development of FinTech projects. The performance evaluation of the most suitable FinTech project, however, is complex and challenging due to the involvement of multiple decision makers, the multi-dimensional nature of the evaluation process and the presence of vagueness and imprecision inherent in the human decision making process. To deal with this problem, this paper presents a multicriteria group decision making approach for evaluating the performance of FinTech projects. Intuitionistic fuzzy numbers are used for effectively modelling the vagueness and imprecision of the decision making process. A multicriteria group decision making approach is developed for calculating an overall performance index for every FinTech project alternative across all criteria. A FinTech project performance evaluation problem is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. © 2020 IEEE.","Financial technology; group decision making; multicriteria; performance; projects","Fintech; Fuzzy sets; Industrial electronics; Decision making process; Evaluation problems; Human decision making; Intuitionistic Fuzzy number; Multi criteria group decision making; Multi dimensional; Performance indices; Project performance; Decision making","","","","","","","Lee, In, Fintech: Ecosystem, business models, investment decisions, and challenges, Business Horizons, 61, 1, pp. 35-46, (2018); Milian, Eduardo Zied, Fintechs: A literature review and research agenda, Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 34, (2019); Mao, Xiaobing, A new method for probabilistic linguistic multi-attribute group decision making: Application to the selection of financial technologies, Applied Soft Computing, 77, pp. 155-175, (2019); Gomber, Peter, Digital Finance and FinTech: current research and future research directions, Journal of Business Economics, 87, 5, pp. 537-580, (2017); Haddad, Christian, The emergence of the global fintech market: economic and technological determinants, Small Business Economics, 53, 1, pp. 81-105, (2019); Wonglimpiyarat, Jarunee, FinTech banking industry: a systemic approach, Foresight, 19, 6, pp. 590-603, (2017); J Serv Res Stud; Zhao, Qun, Improving financial service innovation strategies for enhancing China's banking industry competitive advantage during the fintech revolution: A hybrid MCDM model, Sustainability (Switzerland), 11, 5, (2019); Pérez, César Álvarez, Integrating analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and balanced scorecard (BSC) framework for sustainable business in a software factory in the financial sector, Sustainability (Switzerland), 9, 4, (2017); Procedia Technology, (2013)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","15th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications, ICIEA 2020","2020-11-09 through 2020-11-13","Virtual, Kristiansand","164931","","9781728151694","","","English","Proc.

The study is based on a theoretical model, developed step by step to explain consumers' satisfaction and employers' benefits when the company or the employer introduces FinTech, Machine learning and AI for implementing the policies in programmed decisions. The results and findings show that the application of FinTech, Machine learning and AI will maximize the consumers' satisfaction and employers' benefits. The application of FMAI saves time for the consumers, minimizes the number of trips to the offices, and reduces the confrontations with the unpleasant customer service representatives. FMAI are user friendly, and it has the potential to increase consumers' satisfaction as well as employers' benefits by nicely settling the issues with the consumers and other stakeholders. The consumers remain the focal point and will make sure that consumers will not desert the company.

Every economic crisis gives rise to new financial technologies (NFT). The 2008 crisis also generated new financial technologies which include quantitative easing and low and negative deposit rates. The novelty of our approach consists in treating negative rates as a result of previous development of financial technologies and in analyzing them not only on the national but on the World-System scale. We also emphasize that quantitative easing and close to zero rates passed a kind of a test in Japan in the 1990s and 2000s. Negative deposit rates are an-other step towards a larger production of money in the situation of a) depression and deflationary pressure; b) growing national debt and emission via central banks unprecedented over the recent decades; c) abundance of easy money; and d) increasing merge of the state and private financial interests. The article forecasts a wider spread of negative rates after a new recession (which is to start already in 2020). In search for profitable spheres of application the assets will actively flow to developing markets with higher rates. As a result, the negative rates may promote financial convergence which is a convergence between developed and developing countries in terms of financial strength (as it happens with GDP). If one considers Japan as a testing ground for new financial technologies then one may expect the transition of FRS and ECB to the policy of di-rect purchase of shares because the Japanese Central Bank has been buying shares for the last years. © 2020, Uchitel Publishing House.

Differentiated from the earlier Fintech evolution led by traditional financial institutions, “cross-sector” Fintech that operates at the intersection of financial services and information technology disrupts existing business models of banks while creating novel ecosystem dynamics. This study explores the Fintech ecosystem composition to understand better business model innovation based on underlying ecosystem dynamics while focusing on the specific role of cross-sector actors. These actors have escaped scrutiny despite being mature and experienced and having strong resource bases. Adopting a comparative case study method by considering the China-based Alibaba Group and Tencent, the study’s findings indicate that novel business model developments based on strong technological expertise and scale-based resources by cross-sector Fintech render a functional perspective on fast-developing Fintech industry less practical. Apart from cross-sector Fintech, investors constitute a new dimension in the conceptualization of the Fintech ecosystem. Overall, the interconnectedness of the cross-sector Fintech beyond the Fintech sectors drives the fuzzy boundaries between ecosystems, established business models, terminology definitions, ecosystem actors’ roles and relationships, which appear to become more heterogeneous and changeable over time. The study contributes to the scant literature on Fintech ecosystems and their sustainable development. © 2020 by the authors.

Moreover, it discusses the impact of those actor-level responses on the resilience of entrepreneurial ecosystems (EEs), focusing on how they affect the diversity of and the connectivity among its actors. To address these questions, the paper examines how the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union has influenced the financial technology (FinTech) industry in London, applying data collected from in-depth interviews, covering different groups of stakeholders in London’s FinTech industry, such as angel investors, banks, legal advisers, lobby organizations and private companies. Our results show that political uncertainty and the prospect of institutional change can trigger actor-level responses, which have the potential to modify the diversity as well as the local and non-local connectivity of an EE. Moreover, we demonstrate that the nature of strategic responses of entrepreneurial actors varies significantly, depending on their firms’ characteristics, such as age, size, product specialization and the structure of their egocentric networks. With regard to the latter, our results show that anchor firms play an important role in other firms’ egocentric networks and have the power to shape their strategic responses. © The Author(s) 2020.","Brexit; entrepreneurial ecosystems; FinTech; institutional change; relocation decisions","decision making; entrepreneur; institutional framework; investment; stakeholder; strategic approach; uncertainty analysis; Europe","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (681337)","","Ács, Zoltán J., National Systems of Entrepreneurship: Measurement issues and policy implications, Research Policy, 43, 3, pp. 476-494, (2014); Alvedalen, Janna, A critical review of entrepreneurial ecosystems research: towards a future research agenda, European Planning Studies, 25, 6, pp. 887-903, (2017); Asheim, Björn Terje, Regional innovation systems: The integration of local 'sticky' and global 'ubiquitous' knowledge, Journal of Technology Transfer, 27, 1, pp. 77-86, (2002); undefined, (2015); Borgatti, Stephen P., The network paradigm in organizational research: A review and typology, Journal of Management, 29, 6, pp. 991-1013, (2003); Boschma, Ron A., Towards an Evolutionary Perspective on Regional Resilience, Regional Studies, 49, 5, pp. 733-751, (2015); Cadenasso, Mary L., Dimensions of ecosystem complexity: Heterogeneity, connectivity, and history, Ecological Complexity, 3, 1, pp. 1-12, (2006); Cassis, Youssef, Preface, pp. vii-ix, (2018); Clark, Gordon L., Exit, the firm and sunk costs: Reconceptualizing the corporate geography of disinvestment and plant closure, Progress in Human Geography, 21, 3, pp. 338-358, (1997); Cooke, Philip N., Regional innovation systems: General findings and some new evidence from biotechnology clusters, Journal of Technology Transfer, 27, 1, pp. 133-145, (2002)","F.

Fintech companies are part of a financial lending infrastructure claiming to offer an alternative to ‘big banks’, and are often touted as digitally disruptive technology that is rapidly reshaping financial inclusion agendas and improving the lives of the poor. For many refugees living in camps and informal settlements in Kenya, fintech is often the only viable option for credit or microfinance aid. While refugees are often excluded from credit, the spread of fintech as a solution for direct peer-to-peer aid transfers from the Global North to refugees has resulted in the uneven distribution of credit access and livelihood support. Through fintech, private citizens and groups in the Global North are able to disrupt and subvert refugee assistance, deeming some worthy of aid while others face ongoing exclusion. While fintech remains a hopeful source of greater efficiency and empowerment, the direct transfer of aid money masks profit and corporate power by only extending assistance to those refugees who are appropriately entrepreneurial, that is to say those who will start small businesses and pay back their loans. This paper argues that processes of financial inclusion carried out by and through fintech are still distinguished largely by exclusion. In so doing, this paper highlights a theoretical position that refugee governance is embedded in racial forms of capital accumulation and expropriation. © The Author(s) 2020.","Fintech; Kenya; migration; neoliberalism; race; refugees","financial services; informal settlement; migration; neoliberalism; race; refugee; Kenya","","","","","","","undefined, (2017); Aitken, Rob, All data is credit data': Constituting the unbanked, Competition and Change, 21, 4, pp. 274-300, (2017); Wasted Lives Modernity and Its Outcasts, (2004); undefined, (2018); Bhagat, Ali H., Governing Refugee Disposability: Neoliberalism and Survival in Nairobi, New Political Economy, 25, 3, pp. 439-452, (2020); Bhagat, Ali H., Placing refugees in authoritarian neoliberalism: Reflections from Berlin and Paris, South Atlantic Quarterly, 18, 2, pp. 421-438, (2019); Campbell-Verduyn, Malcolm, Big Data and algorithmic governance: the case of financial practices, New Political Economy, 22, 2, pp. 219-236, (2017); undefined, (2018); undefined, (2018); undefined, (2018)","L.

To appreciate these changes, it is important to maintain theoretical interchange between developments in financial geography and economic geography, its parent discipline. In this paper, we argue that the ways in which evolutionary economic geography impacts strategic coupling in global financial networks are crucial to grasp tomorrow’s geographies of Fintech. Through an in-depth examination of Brussels, we analyse the potential of Fintech opening a window of locational opportunity in financial services. Belgium has put together a strategy to seize this window by leveraging its politically neutral image and Brussels’ existing niche in financial collaboration and infrastructural plumbing. The latter status is exemplified by the presence of global players SWIFT and Euroclear. We analyse how Belgian entrepreneurs and politicians assess Brussels’ locational resources, and strategically couple big financial institutions with small tech startups in order to cultivate a Fintech ecosystem in the service of incumbent finance, constituting a Fin-Tech-State triangle. As such, we document and analyse how the coalescence of finance and technology offers new opportunities for second-tier financial centres, while highlighting the difficulties in reaping these in practice. © The Author(s) 2019.","Belgium; Brussels; digitization; economic geography; ecosystem; financial centres; financial geography; Fintech; innovation systems; strategic coupling","digitization; economic geography; financial market; financial services; infrastructure planning; innovation; state role; strategic approach; technological development; Belgium; Brussels [Belgium]","","","","","American Association of Geographers, AAG; UK Research and Innovation, UKRI, (ES/S010416/1); UK Research and Innovation, UKRI","We would like to thank editor Henry Yeung and three anonymous referees for their constructive engagement with our work.

Since no vaccine has been developed for this disease so far, lockdown, work from home, and social distancing and only a few essential services were allowed to open. Lockdown and restricted movement of people was the only solution to control this crisis. These steps taken by all the countries have stopped all the commercial activities which left all businesses, banks, and financial institutions to count losses and cost. The big question which has emerged that whether e-collaboration between banks and technology continues to be the key to success for finding solutions to the problems in this new environment which COVID-19 has created.

Doing so is to better understand in what way the fintech firms have been promoting the global movement of sustainable development goals (SDGs) in the local context. Design/methodology/approach: This study engages qualitative methods. This paper first reviews relevant literature related to fintech and establishes the substantive definition of Islamic fintech. Further, the existing literature of SDGs is explored to understand its original idea and its recent implementation, particularly in Indonesia. Following this, the official reports from the domestic regulators are referred to select the fintech firms which meet the criteria of Islamic fintech lending based on the proposed definition. The selected firms are then analysed based on several themes which best capture their position in promoting the SDGs. Finally, the discussion is linked to the recent performance of Indonesia in implementing SDGs. Findings: This work finds that the reviewed fintech firms have been promoting the idea of financial inclusion, for example, financing the underdeveloped sectors such as agriculture and small and micro enterprises (SMEs). Furthermore, the selected fintech firms are also found to collect and distribute Islamic social funds such as infaq (charity spending), waqf (endowment) and sadaqah (voluntary charity). Besides, the firms are also found to initiate charity programmes for underprivileged community. In some degree, these findings are synonymous of the firms’ effort in promoting SDG of ending poverty (SDG 1) and hunger (SDG 2) and reducing the inequalities (SDG 10). Research limitations/implications: The discussion of this work does not provide any positivist generalisation due to the method used. Practical implications: The Indonesian Government is advised to legally engage with the existing fintech firms and other related stakeholders to best solve its recent issue of the declining trend in SDG 15 (life on land). Social implications: This work elaborates in what way the Islamic fintech lending has been promoting the SDGs in Indonesian context. In some extent, such discussion can best challenge the social issue of fintech which has been stigmatised of bringing mafsadah (harm), as subjectively claimed by one particular religious group in Indonesia. Originality/value: This study is among the pioneers which offers the definition of Islamic fintech and further explains its position in endorsing the global movement of SDGs. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Indonesia; Islamic fintech; Review; Sustainable development goals (SDGs)","","","","","","","The author would like to thank to Professor Dato’ Dr Mohd Azmi Omar, the President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the International Centre for Education in Islamic Finance (INCEIF), who has given substantive comments and valuable inputs for this paper, particularly for giving the English term of harm for the Arabic term of mafsadah.","Siaran Pers Komitmen Serius Indonesia Dalam Melaksanakan Sustainable Development Goals 2015 2030, (2017); Nature of Infaq and Its Effects on Distribution of Wealth, (2008); Financial Technology Bank Sentralrepublik Indonesia, (2019); Pengumuman Penyelenggara Fintech, (2019); Chen, Kevin, Financial innovation and technology firms: A smart new world with machines, International Symposia in Economic Theory and Econometrics, 25, pp. 279-292, (2018); H 11 Tsunami Selat Sunda Jumlah Korban Jiwa Capai 437 Orang, (2019); Educational Research Planning Conducting and Evaluating Quantitative and Qualitative Research, (2008); Cerita Inspiratif Pak Ipit Yang Kini Menjadi Petani Sukses Crowde Blog, (2018); Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences, (2016); Islamic Fintech Report 2018 Current Landscape and Path Forward, (2018)","F.A.

FinTechs and TechFins have allowed the introduction of new services and changed the way customers interact to satisfy their financial needs. The FinTech landscape is constantly evolving in the market. Different business value propositions are entering the financial services industry, moving from increasing the user's experience to developing a time to market framework for banks to innovate products, processes, and channels, increasing the cost efficiency and looking for a “partnering on order” to lighten the regulatory burdens for banks. The many businesses of banks are changing their value chains, and banks' business models should do the same accordingly. Strategists could no longer take their value chains as a given; choices have to be made on what needs to be protected and maintained, what abandoned and the new on coming to make banks evolve and become more resilient in doing their job. Banking is shifting significantly from a pipeline, vertical paradigm, to open banking business models where open innovation, modularity, and ecosystem-based bank's business model may become the ongoing mainstream and paradigm to follow and develop. Opportunities and threats for banks are many and new ones to re-gaining their role in the market throughout a re-intermediation process. © Copyright © 2020 Omarini.","APIs; bank business model; digitalization; ecosystem; FinTech; open banking; platform; re-intermediation","","","","","","","","Adner, Ron, Value creation in innovation ecosystems: How the structure of technological interdependence affects firm performance in new technology generations, Strategic Management Journal, 31, 3, pp. 306-333, (2010); Armstrong, Mark, Competition in two-sided markets, RAND Journal of Economics, 37, 3, pp. 668-691, (2006); Journal of Finance, (1976); Implications of Fintech Developments for Banks and Bank Supervisors, (2017); Bank Intermediation Activity in A Low Interest Rate Environment, (2019); Annual Red Book Report on Payments and Financial Infrastructures, (2019); Where do Consumers Fit in the Fintech Stack Governor Lael Brainard at Fintech Risks and Opportunities an Interdisciplinary Approach A Conference Sponsored by the University of Michigan Ann Arbor Mi November 16 2017, (2017); Payment Services Directive Psd2, (2017); Campbel, Tim S., Information Production, Market Signalling, and the Theory of Financial Intermediation, Journal of Finance, 35, 4, pp. 863-882, (1980); Open Innovation the New Imperative for Creating and Profiting from Technology, (2003)","A.

Aiding a non-profit organization with financial aspects is a common concern due to lack of transparency in flow of funds taking place for the indicated social issues. There is an immediate need for a channel or mechanism to support and validate the cash flow in such scenarios. In this paper, we explore the generic issues in this topic and propose our idea to solve the same. This paper talks about a financial platform backed by a bank X, that channelizes, reports and provides earmarked funds from charity accounts of donors (just like a regular Fixed Deposit account online interface) to accounts of Non-Profitable Government Organizations (NGOs) aka beneficiaries (irrespective of banks). This significantly solves the challenge posed by lack of transparency and accountability on the part of NGOs and dramatically increases donor confidence and thereby the number of donors, average donation size and frequency. © 2020 IEEE.","Banking; Charity Account; Credibility; Donation; Donor fund management; Funding; Non-Government Organization; Socio-environmental cause; Transaction","Digital communication systems; Fintech; Fixed platforms; Profitability; Transparency; Cash flow; Digital communications; Financial aspects; General publics; Government organizations; Non profit organizations; Online interface; Social issues; Nonprofit organization","","","","","","","One in Three Worldwide Lack Confidence in Ngos; How India Remains Poor as Many as 22 States have Become Poorer; Eliminating Poverty Creating Jobs and Strengthening Social Programs, (2016); Ngos and Organizational Change Discourse Reporting, (2020); Mjp Publishers; Inclusive Growth Poverty and Economic Development in India, (2020); Initiating Policy Change First Edition Accenture Foundation School of Communication Management International University in Germany Bruchsal the Banyan Last Accessed, (2020); World Development Report 2020 Background Paper, (2019); Careindia Annual Report, (2018); Editor in Chief Thomson Reuters Foundation, (2020)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","1st IEEE Bangalore Humanitarian Technology Conference, B-HTC 2020","2020-10-08 through 2020-10-10","Vijiyapur","166965","","9781728187945","","","English","Proc.

As countries all over the world adopted preventive strategies ranging from voluntary isolations to stringent lockdowns, people and businesses were required to adjust their dispositions to the new normal resulting in new behaviors. The customer behaviour in financial services was also impacted and especially in developing economies as people were required to move to digital financial platforms at haste. In recent times, Fintech services are on a steady rise globally but their presence in the emerging markets is in a nascent stage and adoption by the low-income segment customers has largely been elusive. Much work is required to understand the needs of this customer cohort to identify factors for product adoption. This study investigates the impact on financial behavior among low-income segment customers for Fintech services due to the pandemic. By testing a set of hypotheses regarding inclination to adopt Fintech the study presents prominent antecedents such as fear, social influence, awareness and trust that led to positive product adoption. The study discusses the theoretical and managerial implications of the study and presents direction for future research. © 2020 TRANSNATIONAL MARKETING JOURNAL.

FinTech changes the way people pay, send money, borrow, lend, and invest. FinTech enables financial solutions and innovative business models resulting the fusion of finance and smart mobile technology. The emergence of FinTech-related products causes major disruptions in financial services. Though it is yet far from replacing current financial services, it offers financial products and services by non-financial sectors into automation, user-friendly, efficient, and transparent just like banking and financial sectors. The paper discusses its concept, characteristics, and some case studies of local FinTech in Indonesia. In addition, the study deployed text mining analysis to find out the correlation and patterns of FinTech’s characteristics. Then the case analysis highlights a comparative assessment between local FinTech in Indonesia versus global FinTech players within local market-based completion.

The first step that every bank should take is proper investment in financial technologies. Instead of Kazakhstani banks, however, it is the government that is making huge efforts to develop the FinTech market. The goal of this review paper is to evaluate the development of the FinTech market of Kazakhstan and demonstrate the inefficiency of investments for the main industry of the financial market, namely, Kazakhstani second-tier banks. Review of studies on Kazakhstan's fintech market development made along with testing the hypothesis that government investments have no relationship with bank revenues. A relationship analysis was conducted between on the one hand “FinTech investments in Kazakhstan” and on the other hand “revenues from account management”, “Revenues from lending and financing”, “Revenues from payments”, and “Revenues from financial assets and capital markets” of the banking industry of Kazakhstan and the US. The analysis showed the weakest relationship of “FinTech investments in Kazakhstan” to “revenues from lending and financing” for Kazakhstan and equally weak relationship to “revenues from account management”, “Revenues from payments”, and “Revenues from financial assets and capital markets”. In addition, analysis shows that all four types of revenue have a strong relationship with investment for the US and correlation analysis resulted in the strongest relationship to “revenues from payments” for the US. Analysis points out positive relationship of investments to fintech market of US and reverse state for Kazakhstan. Findings: The level of penetration of FinTech in the Kazakhstani market is markedly below that of developed economies. Investments in FinTech are more income efficient for US banks than is the case with Kazakhstani banks. Kazakhstan's financial market mostly consists of commercial banks and efforts to develop the FinTech market largely sourced from the government have no relation with bank incomes. © 2020.

To track this new sector garnering investor attention, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods and Nasdaq, came up with KBW Nasdaq Financial Technology Index (KFTX) on July 18, 2016 comprising of 49 constituents. The objective of this paper is to compare KFTX performance with the leading market indices, including S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average index. The data is collected for a period of 12 months, 24 months and 34 months starting from July 18, 2016. The findings of the analysis suggest that the returns for KFTX are consistently higher for 12 months, 24 months and 34 months over S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average. The cross section analysis of the 48 KFTX index constituents sub-classified into eight categories representing several different financial industry groups and businesses indicate that for the 34 months period networks and payments gave returns of 82.1% and 71.6% whereas asset management business gave an average negative return of - 51.0% and the specialty marketplace lenders gave a return of 26.6%. This indicates a significant non-uniform growth within the FinTech industry. The findings motivate for an in-depth analysis of the various industry groups and businesses within the FinTech industry and to explore further the reasons and attributes which differentiate these sectors. The study has implications for policy makers, asset management companies and investors in terms of understanding and framing policies for FinTech investments. © 2020","FinTech; index return; KFTX","","","","","","","","Anagnostopoulos, Yiannis, Fintech and regtech: Impact on regulators and banks, Journal of Economics and Business, 100, pp. 7-25, (2018); Georgetown Journal of International Law, (2015); Harvard Business Review, (1995); Future of Fintech in Capital Markets, (2016); Dranev, Yury, The impact of fintech M&A on stock returns, Research in International Business and Finance, 48, pp. 353-364, (2019); Drasch, Benedict J., Integrating the ‘Troublemakers’: A taxonomy for cooperation between banks and fintechs, Journal of Economics and Business, 100, pp. 26-42, (2018); Global Fintech Adoption Index 2019, (2025); Fama, Eugene F., The Capital Asset Pricing Model: Theory and evidence, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 18, 3, pp. 25-46, (2004); Stock Market Indices A Principal Components Analysis, (1964); Fintech and Market Structure in Financial Services Market Developments and Potential Financial Stability Implications, (2019)","S.

The security-related issues considered by large enterprises entail relatively high costs in initial technology development and are closely related to infrastructure building. Large enterprises are focused on developing overall security-related technologies, whereas middle-standing enterprises are striving to develop infrastructure-related technologies, with particular emphasis on elementary technologies. Small and medium-sized enterprises are also making efforts to develop user-centered technologies that can directly be used in fintech.

Transparency is further contingent on the market actor: actors with lesser status and market legitimacy are more likely to seek to cocreate transparency with market actors of greater or similar status and legitimacy. The article concludes that in commercial spaces, publicity’s relationship to transparency is not only determined by market logic, but that all market logics are being drawn further toward a technological definition of transparency as “shareveillance,” as more segments of economic life become platformized. © 2020 SAGE Publications.","B2B content; digital marketing; discourse; fintech; transparency; value cocreation","article; discourse analysis; logic; marketing; mass medium","","","","","","","System of Professions an Essay on the Division of Expert Labor, (1988); Athanasopoulou, Pinelopi, Determining relationship quality in the development of business-to-business financial services, Journal of Business-to-Business Marketing, 13, 1, pp. 87-120, (2006); Bernards, Nick, The poverty of fintech?

We first construct and measure a bank FinTech index using web crawler technology and word frequency analysis. The results show that the development of bank FinTech is faster in state-owned banks than in other banks. Moreover, among the five subareas of bank FinTech, the development of internet technology is ahead of artificial intelligence technology, blockchain technology, cloud computing technology, and big data technology. Then, the impacts of bank FinTech on credit risk are examined. We find that bank FinTech significantly reduces credit risk in Chinese commercial banks, and further analyses show that the negative effects of bank FinTech on credit risk are relatively weak among large banks, state-owned banks, and listed banks. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Bank FinTech; China; Commercial banks; Credit risk","","","","","","Xi’an Jiaotong University, XJTU; Shanghai Jiao Tong University, SJTU; National Social Science Fund of China, NSSFC, (19CJY065); National Social Science Fund of China, NSSFC","Funding text 1: We very much appreciate the insightful comments and suggestions from the editor and the anonymous reviewer of Pacific-Basin Finance Journal.

Based on the stock returns of U.S. financial and FinTech institutions, we estimate pairwise risk spillovers by using the Granger causality test across quantiles. We consider the whole distribution: the left tail (bearish case), the right tail (bullish case) and the center of the distribution and construct three types of spillover networks (downside-to-downside, upside-to-upside, and center-to-center) and obtain network-based spillover indicators. We find that linkages in the network are stronger in the bearish case when the risk of spillover is higher. FinTech institutions' risk spillover to financial institutions positively correlates with financial institutions' increase in systemic risk.

Second, it examines how each FinTech development affects traditional FIs, in both positive and negative ways. Third, it explores how FIs are currently managing FinTech innovations. It also suggests ways through which these institutions could best utilize FinTech to better serve their customers and eventually optimize the overall financial system. Finally, following the book's focus on man's role at the center of technology advancement, this chapter discusses whether FIs' customers' needs are still placed at the center of FIs' incentives to adapt new technology, and if not, how can we focus back to the people that the financial system ultimately serves. © 2021, IGI Global.","","","","","","","","","Adhami, Saman, Why do businesses go crypto?

Design/methodology/approach: Using the existing literature, books, website articles, and online news to explore and address various aspects of FinTech and incorporating the acquired knowledge to illustrate the UAE's initiatives and efforts in adopting and promoting FinTech. Findings: FinTech is the marriage of Finance and Technology, which has existed a long time ago. Hence, the future calls for collaboration between FinTech leaders and traditional financial institutions to ensure global financial growth. Moreover, FinTech can accelerate the development of Islamic Finance through its powerful tools that can be Sharia compatible, and it can lead to a better sustainable future via empowering and enabling Green Finance. Using this acquired knowledge, the chapter illustrates that the UAE has become a global and regional FinTech hub as it contributes profoundly to the empowerment of FinTech via providing the ideal ecosystem for FinTech initiatives to thrive, which has been witnessed to be extremely powerful, especially during challenging times like the Covid-19 pandemic. Research limitations/implications: Future research that would tackle different aspects of FinTech in the UAE can use this chapter as a guide toward acknowledging the imperative and the role of FinTech in facilitating financial transactions and perhaps explore ways by which FinTech can be used for wealth protection by paying deeper attention to RegTech and Cy-bersecurity.

Design/methodology/approach: We survey the effects of FinTech on three different aspects of household finance: payments, lending and portfolio decisions. Specifically, we examine the impact of digital payments, mobile money, FinTech lending, marketplace lending, robo-advising and crowd-funding. Findings: Studies suggest that FinTech has positively benefited households by increasing consumption and borrowing. This allows them to smoothen their consumption across time. Furthermore, there is an improvement in their portfolio diversification. Nonetheless, there is also evidence that certain households overconsume and borrow beyond their means. Originality/value: Despite the importance of this topic, there has been a lack of empirical evidence until recently. In this paper, we take stock of the empirical evidence in the literature through the lens of household finance. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","FinTech; Household finance; Lending; Payments; Portfolio Investments","","","","","","","We thank Kylie Lim and Enqi Teo for outstanding research assistance.","Measuring the Gig Economy Current Knowledge and Open Issues, (2018); Manuscript, (2018); Agarwal, Sumit, Do banks pass through credit expansions to consumers who want to borrow?, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 133, 1, pp. 129-190, (2018); Manuscript, (2019); Manuscript, (2019); Aea Papers and Proceedings, (2019); Manuscript, (2020); Agrawal, Ajay K., Some simple economics of crowdfunding, Innovation Policy and the Economy, 14, 1, pp. 63-97, (2014); Agrawal, Ajay K., Crowdfunding: Geography, Social Networks, and the Timing of Investment Decisions, Journal of Economics and Management Strategy, 24, 2, pp. 253-274, (2015); How Debit Cards Enable the Poor to Save More, (2017)","S.

However, there is a downside, represented by the lack of organic regulation that defines the perimeter of legality. World legislators, Europeans in particular, have started building a structured legal framework and to prevent (or to catch) opportunistic or criminal behaviors. Among the unavoidable challenges for the anti-money laundering system are those related to the development of FinTech which produces significant volumes of transactions. In this paper it is provided a systematic review of a) the most common money laundering patterns; b) the European anti-money laundering legal framework, and c) the most recent and relevant fraud cases detected by the enforcements agencies. The main objective of this research is to verify whether the behavior of economic players within the FinTech sector can be contained within the limits of legality. Another objective, far from secondary, is to analyze the current patterns that lead to money laundering, also verifying whether there are tools, within the FinTech itself, capable of exploiting technologies and identifying dark or illegal practices. The recent case study of scandals within the FinTech industry further helps to support the hypotheses and conclusions of the research itself. © 2020 ACM.","Cybersecurity; Dark Web; Fintech; Fraud detection; Money Laundering","Crime; Electronic money; Information management; Laundering; Anti-money laundering; Current patterns; Financial service; Illegal practices; Legal frameworks; Money laundering; Systematic Review; Fintech","","","","","","","Moşteanu, Narcisa Roxana, Digital systems and new challenges of financial management – fintech, XBRL, blockchain and cryptocurrencies, Quality - Access to Success, 21, 174, pp. 159-166, (2020); Faccia, Alessio, Accounting information systems and ERP in the UAE.

(2) Are the markets accommodative enough for new innovative financial projects? (3) What are the main drivers of FinTech phenomenon? (4) Will FinTech shape the financial landscape going forward? By constructing four indices that can influence and drive FinTech market entry, such as (1) demand factors, (2) supply factors, (3) business environment, and (4) investment climate and by applying a z-score methodology, the results point out which economy is better prepared for a challenging wave of innovative changes in the financial sector relatively to the other economies included in the study. The authors focus on the EU countries over a period of 12 years (2007-2018). The FinTech market indices are computed by taking into account a wide variety of variables such as the level of financial inclusion, the available technology and infrastructure, the ease of starting new business, and the risk factors related to investment climate for all EU economies. © 2021 by IGI Global.

The main hypothesis says the success of the process of adapting banks to new competition rules requires the development of individual strategies and business models, taking into account an adequate organizational culture and, within it, a risk culture. To verify this assumption, the relationships between significant competitive features of banks in the digital environment, risk management, and risk culture are presented. The analyses of selected strategies and digital business models are trying to answer the question, to what extent it is possible to implement a new approach, useful in constructing effective solutions for banks to reduce the threats, especially created by FinTechs and BigTechs. © 2021 by IGI Global.

The novelty of the research approach resides in being the first study computing an EU FinTech index for the EU member countries. The index gathers four dimensions and provides insights on whether the FinTech environment in one country is better or worse compared to other countries in the sample. Countries' ranking based on index scores computed for two different years show that Sweden, Finland, Luxembourg, and Germany are always placed on the top of the hierarchy. Therefore, they exhibit real development opportunities in this regard. At the opposite are some countries in South-Eastern Europe that persistently record the lowest FinTech index scores; thus, there is still room for improvements in terms of market players' presence, existing regulation, access to digital financial inclusion. © 2021 by IGI Global.

Design/methodology/approach: With data collected from 753 fintech users, this study applies partial least square structural equation modeling to compare and select the research model with the most predictive power. Findings: The results show that financial self-efficacy, technological self-efficacy and confirmation positively affect perceived usefulness. Among these factors, financial self-efficacy and technological self-efficacy have both direct and indirect effects through confirmation on perceived usefulness. Perceived usefulness and confirmation are positively related to satisfaction. Finally, perceived usefulness and satisfaction positively influence fintech continuance intentions. Originality/value: To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the earliest studies that investigates the effect of domain-specific self-efficacy on fintech continuance intentions, which enriches the existing research on fintech and deepens our understanding of users' fintech continuance intentions. We distinguish between financial self-efficacy and technological self-efficacy and specify the relationship between self-efficacy and continuance intentions.

The presence of Fintech Peer to Peer Lending companies in Indonesia is the answer to the limited access to finance faced by MSME entrepreneurs. However, the presence of Fintech Peer to Peer Lending for MSMEs in Indonesia can cause legal problems. This study aims to find a juridical basis for the relation between Fintech Peer to Peer Lending organizers and MSME entrepreneurs and to find constitutional protection for Fintech Peer to Peer Lending organizers and MSME entrepreneurs. The method used is juridical empirical, using primary data in the form of primary and secondary legal materials. The study outcomes concluded that the weak legal protection for the lenders (borrowers), which in this case is MSMEs, is due to the insufficiency of strict legitimate rules in managing the Fintech Peer to Peer Lending business. So that the implementation of the Peer to Peer Lending Fintech business needs to be regulated under the Law so that it can be charged with criminal sanctions. © 2020, University of Muhammadiyah Malang.

However, regulation of these new services faces a double challenge: to keep pace with innovation and facilitate new market entries while at the same time understanding and managing the regulatory risks that are involved. At this stage, the existing EU regulatory framework is of little help: the bulk of the present body of financial regulation stems from a different time, with different regulatory problems in mind. EU regulation is also very slow to change and to adapt. Therefore, this paper proposes a regulatory ""sandbox""- an experimentation space - as a step towards a regulatory environment where such new business models can thrive. A sandbox would allow market participants to test fintech services in the real market, with real consumers, but under the close scrutiny of the supervisor. The benefit of such an approach is that it fuels the development of new business practices and reduces the ""time to market""cycle of financial innovation, while simultaneously safeguarding consumer protection. At the same time, a sandbox allows for mutual learning in a technical field which is sometimes poorly understood, both for firms and for the regulator. This would help to reduce the prevalent regulatory uncertainty for all market participants. In the particular EU legal framework with various layers of legal instruments, the implementation of such a sandbox is not straightforward. In this paper, we propose a ""guided sandbox"", operated by the EU Member States, but with endorsement, support, and monitoring by EU institutions. This innovative approach would be somewhat uncharted territory for the EU, and thereby also contribute to the future development of EU financial market governance as a whole. © The Author(s), 2020.","","","","","","","","82 European Banking Federation, supra, note 76, and Banking Stakeholder Group, supra, note 16.

Technological innovations such as Fintech are rapidly transforming BFSI and have major competitiveness implications for legacy players. Key objective of our study is to understand the dimensions of innovation and identify options-particularly one based on MoT for sustainability-for firms in emerging countries. We adapt a mixed method approach, where analysis of factual secondary data will be complemented by insights from literature review and experts. Factual views indicate significant role of regional banks of Indian origin (BIOs), some of them are innovating quite well leveraging capabilities of increasing competitiveness of software (SW or ICT) firms and Fintech ventures, including service, product and platform innovations. We analyse the patterns of competitiveness using alternate frameworks of competitiveness from Porter Diamond to competitiveness Assets-Processes-Performance (APP), focusing on trends for Fintech's trying to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) and 'Digital Transformation'. Findings indicate major disruptive threats to incumbent 'banking, financial services and insurance'(BFSI) majors in many emerging countries from fintech as well as technology giants such as GAFA. While efforts in countries such as India through 'Unified Payment Interface (UPI)' may address issues of financial access, evolving a dominant design demands much bigger 'architectural innovation'. We draw implications for different stakeholders and also suggest topics for further research.

As Fintech is innovative but inherently unpredictable, customers are still hesitant to adopt and use Fintech, which ultimately affects its growth. To achieve the sustainable development and growth of Fintech, an in-depth investigation of Fintech continuance intentions is required. To investigate continuous-use behavior in a Fintech context, this study focuses on two relevant issues: uncertainty and information technology (IT) quality. Uncertainty is more critical in Fintech than in traditional e-banking transactions because Fintech transactions are complicated and less predictable. IT quality is also crucial to Fintech success because IT plays a key role in Fintech transactions. This study mainly explores the relationship between uncertainty and IT quality, both of which significantly affect Fintech continuance intentions. For the purpose, we integrated an IT quality-based perspective with a trust-based model to investigate Fintech continuance intentions. Our results demonstrate that system quality is negatively related to perceived risk, whereas information quality is positively related to trust. Service quality is the most important quality factor for controlling uncertainty and encouraging continued use of Fintech. We found a more extended role of IT in Fintech than in other digital services. This study provides Fintech providers with the practical guidance in the design and implementation of Fintech innovation, thereby achieving the sustainable development of Fintech. © 2020 by the authors.","Fintech; Fintech continuance intention; Information quality; Perceived risk; Service quality; System quality; Trust","banking; information technology; perception; quality control; service quality; sustainable development; uncertainty analysis","","","","","","","Deng, Xiang, Can ESG indices improve the enterprises' stock market performance?-An empirical study from China, Sustainability (Switzerland), 11, 17, (2019); Zavolokina, Liudmila, FinTech - What's in a name?, (2016); Pulse of Fintech 2018; World Bank Research and Policy Briefs, (2018); Ryu, Hyun-sun, What makes users willing or hesitant to use Fintech?: the moderating effect of user type, Industrial Management and Data Systems, 118, 3, pp. 541-569, (2018); Journal of Risk Management in Financial Institutions, (2016); Namahoot, Kanokkarn Snae, Assessing the intentions to use internet banking: The role of perceived risk and trust as mediating factors, International Journal of Bank Marketing, 36, 2, pp. 256-276, (2018); Nicolaou, Andreas I., Perceived information quality in data exchanges: Effects on risk, trust, and intention to use, Information Systems Research, 17, 4, pp. 332-351, (2006); Song, Honglei, Customer adoption of internet banking: An integration of TAM with trust, perceived risk, and quality, pp. 264-268, (2010); Evolution of Fintech A New Post Crisis Paradigm, (2015)","K.S.

The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of FinTech applications and crowdfunding on customer retention in Islamic banks of Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates. A structured questionnaire consisting of 31 items was designed to gather data from 535 customers of selected banks from both countries through strata sampling. Various statistical tests were done to check the association between FinTech applications including crowdfunding and customer retention using SPSS 25.0. The results indicated that financing application of FinTech has no relevance to customer retention while as other variables such as payments, advisory services, compliance and crowdfunding has an impact on retaining customers in Islamic banks of these two countries. The conclusion of this study emphasis on expanding the range of applications of FinTech services by Islamic banks so that the customer will stay longer with the bank.

The success of the intuitive Sandbox has however led to it being replicated in jurisdictions worldwide, eager to benefit from the growth of FinTech. Competition for high-calibre start-ups means the UK’s post-Brexit Sandbox may need to go further than its existing FinTech Sector Strategy to continuing attracting and developing firms helping the City of London to remain the global centre of finance as perceived in the UK’s Industrial Strategy. The article examines existing regulations and analyses how the UK can develop an enhanced structure to both further attract and accommodate legitimate high-calibre FinTech entrepreneurs, whilst offering strong client and investor protections to ensure financial stability. It proposes unprecedented legal and policy reforms for the Sandbox structure, including a permissible model to capitalise on funding from amateur private investors worldwide. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","financial technology; initial coin offerings; Sandbox","","","","","","Qatar National Research Fund, QNRF, (NPRP11S-1119-170016); Qatar National Research Fund, QNRF","This work was supported by Qatar National Research Fund [grant number NPRP 11S-1119-170016].

The existence of ICT has also increasingly influenced the way business activities are financed via online, known as financial technology (fintech)-based peer-to-peer (P2P) lending companies. This chapter is based on a study which aims to explore the use of e-commerce by small businesses, represented by micro and small enterprises (MSEs), and the role of P2P lending companies in financing MSEs in Indonesia. As an exploratory investigation, it adopts a descriptive analysis. It analyses secondary data and primary data collected from interviews with randomly selected P2P lending companies and owners of MSEs that have been granted loans from these companies. The results suggest that the use of e-commerce by MSEs in Indonesia is still very low. Although national data is not available yet because it is a new phenomenon, this chapter suggests that the emergence of fintech, especially the P2P lending category, will expand MSEs access to funding from formal sources. © 2021, IGI Global.","","","","","","","","","Factors Affecting the Adoption of E Commerce by Small Businesses A Case Study, (2010); Zamberi Bin Ahmad, Syed Zamberi, An Empirical Study of Factors Affecting e-Commerce Adoption among Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises in a Developing Country: Evidence from Malaysia, Information Technology for Development, 21, 4, pp. 555-572, (2015); Alam, Syed Shah, An empirical study of factors affecting electronic commerce adoption among SMEs in Malaysia, Journal of Business Economics and Management, 12, 2, pp. 375-399, (2011); Adoption of B2b E Commerce by the Smes in Bangladesh an Empirical Analysis, (2009); Adoption of E Commerce by the Smes in Bangladesh the Effects of Innovation Characteristics and Perceived Risk, (2009); Bakos, Yannis, Bundling and competition on the internet, Marketing Science, 19, 1, pp. 63-82, (2000); Cnbc, (2017); Barry, Helen, SMEs and electronic commerce: A departure from the traditional prioritisation of training?, Journal of European Industrial Training, 26, 7, pp. 316-326, (2002); Analisa Ketenagakerjaan Usaha Mikro Kecil 2017, (2017); Profilindustrimikrodan Kecil, (2018)","","","IGI Global","","","","","","","1799849848; 9781799849858; 9781799849841","","","English","Handb. of Res. on Innov. and Dev. of E-Commer. and E-Bus. in ASEAN","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137721668"

However, the continues use of fintech is still doubted by scholars. As a result, this chapter aims to comprehend whether, and why, higher education students, who are future entrepreneurs, would be willing, or hesitate to utilize fintech. Data was collected from 350 higher education students from universities in Bahrain. Only those students who had prior experience with cashless online payment systems were the selected target population for this study's online survey. The findings confirmed that risk negatively effects the intent for the continence of using fintech, and convenience baring the strongest positive effect.

A regulatory sandbox is one of the tools opted by financial regulators in certain jurisdictions to regulate the rapid growth of fintech products within their financial sphere. The pioneer of which was the UK's market and conduct regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) was also one of the first jurisdictions that followed suit. One of the basic structures in a sandbox is the eligibility criteria that the regulators draw for the financial service provider to participate in the sandbox. This chapter shall address the entry requirements in both jurisdictions as the structure of the regulatory sandboxes differs from one jurisdiction to another.

Ever since its evolution FinTech has been growing tremendously, despite its positive and negative aspects. In the literature review, there are many factors affecting the adoption of FinTech. It was found that the ease of use of technology (Technology Acceptance Theory), investment decisions in crowdfunding (Decision Theory), and the risks involved in the adoption of FinTech (Prospect Theory) are the main factors that might affect the adoption of FinTech. However, there is a paucity of studies linking all these factors in the adoption of FinTech using these theories. This research project investigates the influence of these factors in the adoption of FinTech. In order to analyze these factors, a questionnaire was used. As a result, it was found that there is a positive relationship between the ease of use and FinTech's adoption; between FinTech's adoption and investment decisions in crowdfunding and between the level of risks when adapting to FinTech. © 2021, IGI Global.","Adoption; Bahrain; Factors; Financial Institutions; FinTech","","","","","","","","A Google Trend Search Reveals that the Interest Over Time for the Word Fintech Increased Exponentially in 2014; Global Venture Capital Investment in Fintech in 2017, (2018); Alt, Rainer, FinTech and the transformation of the financial industry, Electronic Markets, 28, 3, pp. 235-243, (2018); Invest in Experience Financial Services in Bahrain, (2017); Consumers International, (2017); Why do Many Americans Mistrust the Federal Reserve, (2015); Implications of Fintech Developments for Banks and Bank Supervisors, (2018); New Eu Laws Legitimize Fintech Challengers, (2016); Mckinsey Global Banking Annual Review 2016, (2017); Fintech Green Finance and Developing Countries May, (2017)","","","IGI Global","","","","","","","9781799832591; 9781799832577","","","English","Innov.

Further, the consequences of the new payments system directive (PSD2) in Europe and blockchain applications are discussed. For instance, money transfer and payments have the highest rate of adoption (ROA) while insurance services have the highest speed of growing ROA due to relative advantages, high compatibility and trialability levels, and low level of complexity and uncertainty. Cross country comparisons include descriptive statistics about fintech deal value and volume, innovation rank, B2C commerce market, ROA and internet penetration. Germany is the only country listed in all of the top 10 ranking lists, followed by the U.S., the U.K., and France. Also, China, India, and Canada have distinguished success in terms of fintech indicators while the growth in Japan is expected to be slow. Accordingly, ROA in five emerging markets is much higher than some of the developed countries which can be explained by the Cancian Theory. © 2021, IGI Global.","","","","","","","","","Xxi Int Conf Systems Analysis in Engineering and Control Saec 2017, (2017); undefined, (2018); Journal of Financial Perspectives, (2015); undefined; Cancian, F., Stratification and risk-taking: a theory tested on agricultural innovation., American Sociological Review, 32, 6, pp. 912-927, (1967); Chung, Mihyun, The internet information and technology research directions based on the fourth industrial revolution, KSII Transactions on Internet and Information Systems, 10, 3, pp. 1311-1320, (2016); Technology at Work the Future of Innovation and Employment, (2015); Econtent, (2016); Comin, Diego A., An exploration of technology diffusion, American Economic Review, 100, 5, pp. 2031-2059, (2010); Japanese Fintech in the Global Context, (2017)","","","IGI Global","","","","","","","9781799832591; 9781799832577","","","English","Innov.

The authors propose that the new opportunities of FinTech include better digital banking experience, personalized customer services, high-level data security, cost-effective, and efficient services. On the other hand, FinTech results in risks such as security risk, technical risk, regulation risk, financial risk, and reputation risk.

India is transitioning into a dynamic ecosystem offering Fintech start-ups a platform to grow into billion-dollar unicorns. From tapping new segments to exploring foreign markets, Fintech in India is pursuing multiple targets. The traditionally cash-driven Indian economy has responded well to the Fintech opportunity, primarily triggered by a surge in e-commerce, and Smartphone penetration. However, India's growth is still not comparable in scale to its global counterparts but is stacked well, due to a strong talent pipeline of the tech workforce.

The analysis is based on a country-level dataset covering the period of 2007–2017 and 107 countries. The results reveal that greater FinTech establishment intensity characterizes smaller countries, countries with stronger information and communications technology (ICT) services clusters, and countries that have experienced a crisis during the recent decade. Greater FinTech establishment intensity is also observed in countries with greater tertiary education enrolment rates, stronger university-industry cooperation, greater fixed line availability, and overall ICT readiness. The macroeconomic situation and indicators of financial development prove to be important determinants of FinTech formation. Given the importance of several dimensions of location’s diamond in FinTech formation, FinTech entrepreneurs could benefit from a careful analysis of the diamond of locations that they are considering as potential places of doing business. Countries hoping to become more attractive FinTech establishment sites, in turn, should focus on the elimination of weaknesses in the location’s diamond in close co-operation with FinTechs. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","FinTechs; location; Porter’s diamond model; start-up establishment","electronic commerce; financial crisis; financial system; formation mechanism; higher education; information and communication technology; macroeconomics","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (952410, 952574); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; Tallinna Tehnikaülikool, TTÜ","This work was supported by the Tallinn University of Technology under grants B57 ‘Efficiency in Financial Sector in Light of Changing Regulatory Environment’ and BHV1 ‘Digital Development in Finance’.

The findings show that reliability/trust and ease of use are the main issues in using a financial service. Millennials are more aware (48%) of Fintech services than Gen Z (38%), which is different from the global view where Gen Z is the highest. The smartphone penetration rate is 100% among both generations, while the financial inclusion ratio in Palestine is around 36.4%; these clear indicators are the main Fintech drivers to promote Fintech services in Palestine, and these are global indicators for Fintech adoption intention. Both generations (84%) intend to use e-wallet services, Millennials (87%) and Gen Z is (70%) prefer using real-time services.

The development of shadow banking in financial technology-based loan services in Indonesia is categorized into two, namely Financial Technology-Based Lending and Borrowing Services that have been licensed and registered by the Financial Services Authority and illegal financial technology-based loan services. Problems and risks stem from illegal activities. The Investment Alert Task Force and the National Consumer Protection Agency in collaboration with the Ministry of Communication and Information have the authority to crack down on loans and services based on illegal financial technology. The urgency of establishing shadow banking regulations on financial technology-based lending and borrowing services in Indonesia is based on three aspects, namely philosophical aspects based on Article 33 of the 1945 Constitution, sociological aspects based on risk and impact of victims and juridical aspects based on the absence of written sanctions in both regulations has been issued through the Financial Services Authority Regulation. © 2020, Mataram University Faculty of Law.

This service combines financial services and mobile technology to serve consumers more effectively and efficiently relating to their needs of financial services. Its market size is also growing giving sign that the service is widely accepted. However, there is still a lack of study especially relating to consumer behavior in in adopting the service. Therefore, the aim of this research is to study what factors influence consumers in adopting FinTech services by surveying Indonesian consumers. From 250 respondents, there are 204 forms filled. By conducting Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) using Lisrel 8.80 software, all consumer's inputs are computed. From this computation, there are three results that can be drawn. First, it revealed that trust has generally influenced not only user's satisfaction but also his continuance use intention, meanwhile, his satisfaction may not influence his continuance use intention. Second, all factors of convenience, performance, cost advantages, referent network size and perceived complementary are all together influencing user' satisfaction. Third, all factors of authentication, non-repudiation, confidentially, privacy protection, and data integrity are all together needed to be considered. Therefore, any Fintech companies are suggested to be aware of these matters to win their customers in this market. © 2020 IEEE.","Continuance use intention; Fintech; Lisrel; Satisfaction; Structural equation modeling; Trust","Commerce; Fintech; Information management; Privacy by design; Cost advantages; Financial service; Mobile Technology; Non repudiation; Privacy protection; Structural equation modeling; Use intentions; User's satisfaction; Consumer behavior","","","","","Office of Technology Transfer and Procurement; Binus University, (014/VR)","Funding text 1: ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work is supported by Research and Technology Transfer Office, Bina Nusantara University as a part of Bina Nusantara University’s Research Grant entitled Modelling the use of FinTech in Indonesia with contract number: No.014/VR.RTT/III/2018 and contract date: 15 March 2018.; Funding text 2: This work is supported by Research and Technology Transfer Office, Bina Nusantara University as a part of Bina Nusantara University s Research Grant entitled Modelling the use of FinTech in Indonesia with contract number: No.014/VR.RTT/III/2018 and contract date: 15 March 2018.","Future of Fintech and Banking Digitally Disrupted or Reimagined, (2015); Bhattacherjee, Anol, Understanding information systems continuance: An expectation-confirmation model, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 25, 3, pp. 351-370, (2001); Brockner, Joel, Regulatory focus theory and the entrepreneurial process, Journal of Business Venturing, 19, 2, pp. 203-220, (2004); IEEE Trans Veh Technol, (2025); International Journal of Management and Administrative Sciences, (2016); Ha, Youngwook, Use and gratifications of mobile SNSs: Facebook and KakaoTalk in Korea, Telematics and Informatics, 32, 3, pp. 425-438, (2015); Multivariate Data Analysis, (2010); Higgins, E.

The study also considers the analysis of independent attributes, for example, GDP growth, interest rates and Fintech lending capacity and capability that could affect the financial performance of the banks. Moreover, this research emphasizes that competition with Fintech companies could affect banks' performance and the capacity to supply loans which bring the diminishing of banks' capability to disburse their loans, especially to MSMEs. In general, the results show that most of the banks are still capable of increasing lending capacity to MSMEs as mandated by the regulation in the short term. However, in the long term, the intention is moving slowly and tends to decrease, possibly due to the dynamics of economic growth and the development of financial technology companies. In particular, this study avails the strategy and policy that banks should be taking, for example, determining the risk management on capital invested in the long run amid the uncertainty of the economic situation, as reported previously in the long run as the GDP growth affected the MSME financing. Our research also contributes to the improvements of the banks' credit management, the effectiveness of loan distribution, and explains the repercussion of the Fintech lending on MSME. For instance, as mentioned in the analysis, this study suggests that the observations might have significant implications on further investigation on the prioritization of the strategy that optimally used to solve the issues on the allocation of funds by making collaboration between the bank and Fintech companies. In addition, this study is expected to raise concern about financial inclusiveness amid the development of the digital economy. Overall, this research supplies some insights into the evaluation process of banking sector's financial performance and the impact of macro-economy and digital economy through Fintech on the bank lending services towards MSMEs, including analysis contributing to decision-makers in making correct decisions. © 2020 Czech Medical Association J.E.

Design/methodology/approach: The survey was conducted using convenience sampling. Moreover, 205 responses were gathered from users of the Islamic bank. On the same note, the literature on determinants of Islamic FinTech acceptance and TAM was reviewed as well in a bid to contribute to the factors that are instrumental in determining the acceptance of FinTech services. Findings: Findings of the study reveal that Islamic FinTech’s services acceptance is determined by perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and also by another variable, which is consumer innovativeness (CI). On the contrary other factors, self-efficacy and subjective norms are found not to be influential in determining Islamic FinTech’s acceptance by Islamic banking users. Originality/value: TAM is extended in the context of Islamic FinTech. A new variable, namely, CI is tested using TAM. CI is yet to be tested, therefore, this paper will be a useful reference for the policymakers, academicians and future researchers. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Acceptance; Islamic FinTech; Malaysia; TAM","","","","","","","","Acar, Okan, Fintech Integration Process Suggestion for Banks, Procedia Computer Science, 158, pp. 971-978, (2019); Agarwal, Ritu, A Conceptual and Operational Definition of Personal Innovativeness in the Domain of Information Technology, Information Systems Research, 9, 2, pp. 204-215, (1998); International Journal of Islamic Financial Services, (2002); Amin, Hanudin, Determinants of online waqf acceptance: An empirical investigation, Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries, 60, 1, pp. 1-18, (2014); Amin, Hanudin, An integrative approach for understanding Islamic home financing adoption in Malaysia, International Journal of Bank Marketing, 31, 7, pp. 544-573, (2013); Amoako-Gyampah, Kwasi, Perceived usefulness, user involvement and behavioral intention: an empirical study of ERP implementation, Computers in Human Behavior, 23, 3, pp. 1232-1248, (2007); Social Foundations of Thought and Action A Social Cognitive Theory, (1986); Interfaces, (1972); Bhattacherjee, Anol, Acceptance of e-commerce services: The case of electronic brokerages, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Part A:Systems and Humans, 30, 4, pp. 411-420, (2000); Fintech Research Directions to Explore the Digital Transformation of Financial Service Systems, (2019)","I.M.

It is a QR code-based mobile secure payment service that the government, Seoul Metropolitan Government (SMG), bank, and private settlement providers cooperate to reduce small business owners’ commission burden. When a consumer recognizes a QR code as a smartphone app, the fees charged by the merchant’s franchisee will either be lost or significantly lowered as money transfers from the consumer account to the merchant account. SMG started to ease commissions’ burden on small businesses suffering from recession, rising rents, and card fees. However, because of this service started with government policy, ZeroPay started with many controversies, and these issues need to be addressed for the service to settle down stably. The main discussion of this paper is that this service will be applied successfully to the market. The author discusses how the SMG efforts settle successfully with strategically initiated services. © 2020 IGI Global.

Each revolution has its life cycle, its techno-economic paradigm with its structural components of invention, innovation and diffusion. The digital and mobile era is penetrating all areas of life here is the case of technological innovation, the financial market and the agri-food sector; especially, the new architecture of financial services, which is emerging. The FinTech 3.0 era is related to the finance value chain and impacts its business models. New digital technologies are changing agriculture in many dimensions beyond financial services (AgTech). In this scenario, this article aims to understand the three simultaneous challenges, enabled by digital and mobile technologies, which impact the links in the value chains, their actual and financial functioning, and the design of products in the agri-food sector. There is good reason to believe that emerging digital technologies can improve the functioning of agricultural markets at a very low cost per farmer. Digital agricultural services can improve agricultural productivity, the functioning of agricultural supply chains, traceability, connection between producers and the end customer in the face of climate change and environmental stress. New technologies are impacting not only processes and business models but also products and their components, in the case of the disruption of proteins (FoodTech). The success of emerging technological innovations with the greatest potential for agriculture in Latin America and the Caribbean will largely depend on the operation, evolution and maturity of the innovation ecosystems that enhance the opportunities offered by the countries. Disruption in food and agriculture is inevitable, modern products will be superior in multiple attributes, but it is policy makers, investors, companies, entrepreneurs and civil society as a whole who have the power to stop or accelerate its adoption. © 2020, Centro de Investigaciones Agroalimentarias (CIAAL).

If the ambition of FinTech start-ups to create superior screening and monitoring technologies materialises, this advantage would be diminished and regional banks would become superfluous for small firm finance. To explore this claim, the paper in hand analyses qualitative empirical data about the lending processes and rating system use of regional German savings banks. In essence, the results from participant observation and interviews clarify the importance of “real” soft information for critical lending decisions. The context specificity and limited verifiability of “real” soft information hamper it from being hardened through the use of rating systems and other bank-ICT. Though FinTech's scoring technologies may overcome the first limitation, it appears likely that in the course of scoring development “real” soft information will be systematically crowded out due to the manipulation problem. The paper expects improved access to finance for SMEs if FinTech solutions overcome both limitations of “real” soft information use, or if peer-to-peer lending and regional banks coexist. Deteriorated access to finance is expected if FinTech companies displace the relationship banking of regional banks due to enhanced competition, without preserving the advantages of “real” soft information with superior screening and monitoring technologies. The paper concludes with recommendations on how to prevent deteriorated access to finance for small firms by promoting fair competition and FinTech innovations. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","FinTech; peer-to-peer lending; regional banks; relationship banking; small firm finance; soft information","banking; empirical analysis; finance; lending behavior; qualitative analysis; savings; small and medium-sized enterprise; Germany","","","","","Ministry of Economic Affairs, MOEA, (W046A); Ministry of Economic Affairs, MOEA","Funding text 1: The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of the research grant EnerDigit from the Ministry of Economic Affairs of North Rhine-Westphalia and thank all the participants in the ethnographic study as well as Katharine Thomas in addition to the two anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments on an earlier version of this article.

Fintech is considered to have various benefits. However, based on survey conducted by DailySocial and Otoritas Jasa Keuangan finds that the Fintech adoption rate in Indonesia is still relatively low at around 58.1%, this is in line with a penetration level of Fintech in Asia which Indonesia usage level still in 5% compared to China, Hong Kong, and India. In determining Fintech adoption, users tend to do rational calculations by comparing the perceived benefits and risks and will decide to adopt them when the perceived benefits are greater than the risks received. According to some studies, trust can be mediated to reduce some level of risk, thus this study will also include trust variables in the risk-benefit framework to determine user adoption intention on Fintech services in Indonesia. Based on data collected from 100 Fintech users, this study initially investigated whether perceived benefits and risks significantly impacted Fintech adoption intention. Partial Least Square (PLS-SEM) method is used to estimate the relationship between constructs. As a resulting trust, economic benefit and convenience are proven to significantly influence the user to adopt Fintech. While privacy awareness, financial risk, and legal risk are significantly affected by user trust. The hypothesis testing indicates that security risk has the biggest negative effect and convenience has the biggest positive effect on Fintech adoption intention. © 2020 ACM.","Adoption Intention; Fintech; PLS-SEM; Risk-Benefit Framework; Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)","Industrial research; Least squares approximations; Systems engineering; Adoption intention; Economic benefits; Financial service; Hypothesis testing; Partial least square (PLS); Penetration level; Perceived benefits; Privacy awareness; Fintech","","","","","Universitas Indonesia, UI","Funding text 1: The purpose of this paper was to consider how trust, perceived benefits, and perceived risk impacted consumers before adopting Fintech services.

In the next section, we review some of the academic literature in the FinTech area. In the subsequent section, we characterize the financing of FinTech startups, especially by venture capital firms. In the following section, we characterize innovation by FinTech firms as well as by incumbent financial intermediaries. In the next section, we move on to discuss potential sources of value creation by FinTech start-up firms relative to existing incumbent firms: we conjecture that one source of value creation may arise from FinTech startups being able to provide a superior customer experience relative to incumbent firms in various areas of consumer finance. In the following section, we discuss the regulatory environment facing FinTech firms, in their banking as well as in their financial market activities. In the penultimate section, we analyze the buy-versus-build decision facing firms choosing to enter the FinTech sector and discuss the trade-offs that may drive such decisions in practice.

It adopts a balanced approach as a theoretical-analysis perspective, weighing various considerations, and proposes the policy option of FinTech regulation under the principle of interest balance. The analysis aims to contribute new insights to an ongoing debate in China on the relationship between legal and regulatory reform, FinTech innovation, and risk prevention. This article argues that legal challenges, rather than technical problems, remain the key obstacles to effective FinTech regulation. Our proposed hypothesis seeks to explain how a legal regulation achieves balancing the competing interests between FinTech innovation, risk prevention, and financial stability in the booming of China's FinTech. Finally, this article proposes the implementation of goal-oriented responsive regulation by improving the legal framework of FinTech regulatory regimes through policy option. © Cambridge University Press and KoGuan Law School, Shanghai Jiao Tong University 2020.","China; FinTech; legal framework; regulation; risk prevention","","","","","","(FXB2018004); Guangdong Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science"," The authors wish to express their gratitude to the anonymous referees for their helpful comments on an earlier draft.

To overcome regulatory barriers of the fintech industry, regulatory sandboxes have been adopted. The regulatory sandboxes are beneficial to create a fintech ecosystem, but their effectiveness has not been empirically supported. This study aims to find the expected effects of regulatory sandboxes on fintech venture investments empirically. We conducted an analysis using a country-level comparative research method. To analyze it, we selected nine forerunning countries which have initially adopted regulatory sandboxes. For the purpose of validations, a comparative analysis and a regression analysis were conducted. In the results, we found that the adoption of regulatory sandboxes had very positive influences on the growth of the fintech venture investment. The results implied that regulatory sandboxes may play a vital role in increasing the influx of venture capital into the fintech venture ecosystem by removing regulatory uncertainty. The findings of this research contribute to providing the empirical evidences to policy makers in interpretations of the positive impact of regulatory sandboxes. © 2020 by the authors.","Financial innovation; Fintech; Investment; Regulatory sandbox; Venture; Venture capital","","","","","","","","ASIC Regulatory Guide 257, (2017); ASIC Fintech Regulatory Sandbox, (2019); Blind, Knut, The influence of regulations on innovation: A quantitative assessment for OECD countries, Research Policy, 41, 2, pp. 391-400, (2012); Youngsan Law J, (2015); Cbinsights 2029 Fintech Trends to Watch, (2019); Regulatory Sandboxes and Financial Inclusion, (2017); Cliford Chance European Fintech Regulation an Overview, (2017); Regulatory Sandbox and Competition of Financial Technologies in Taiwan, (2020); Douglas J.

In the last 15 years, commercial banks have witnessed a downturn in their performance. Traditional financial market needs FinTech to provide new profit, increase regulatory efficiency and meet customers’ demands. Gradually, various kinds of innovative FinTech business models appear in financial market. Researches on FinTech business model have drawn widespread attention among academics. Lee and Teo (2015) defined FinTech in five principles: low profit margin, light asset, expandability, innovation and easy compliance. The US Financial Stability Board (FSB, 2017) defined FinTech as financial technological innovation resulting in new business models, applications, processes or products. It had a considerable effect on financial markets, institutions and services. Leong et al. (2017) did case study on the business model of 007fendi. Gomber et al. (2017) did a literature review about FinTech and analyzed future research direction. They thought the future Fintech are cross-country and cross-regional peer-to-peer transfer systems, the smart-phone in financial transactions and wearable facilities for financial transaction are the future FinTech. Eickhoff et al. (2017) developed a taxonomy of FinTech business models. Haddad and Lars (2018) thought Fintech occurred more frequently in well-developed economies countries or more fragile financial sectors. FinTech business model is the specific application of FinTech in the economic and financial fields. For example, e-banking integrates internet technology, APP and mobile payment. It enables users to complete bank account transaction at home, which improves the efficiency of bank transactions and saves customers’ time. From the perspective of business model, we can have a more specific understanding of FinTech. We will be clearer about its application and its significance of existence.This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71722007 & 71931001), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (XK1802-5 & buctrc201926).; Funding text 2: This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71722007 & 71931001 ), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities ( XK1802-5 & buctrc201926 ).","Ahlers, Gerrit K.C., Signaling in Equity Crowdfunding, Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, 39, 4, pp. 955-980, (2015); Ahlin, Christian R., Where does microfinance flourish?

Design/methodology/approach: First, the authors review two Chinese entrepreneurial practices in the Fintech sector and low-speed electric vehicles (LSEV) and describe their stylized facts; second, they explore a possible theoretical LTM framework to underscore these practices; third, they make a connection between LTM and existing business models and analyze its significance and practical implications in business, in particular, in developing economies. Findings: The LTM business approach has helped Chinese companies in the Fintech sector and LSEVs gain global attention. The success factors of LTM for businesses are identifying a specific customer base, being aware of localization products and playing skillfully with regulations; the LTM approach has several overlaps with existing studies on niche products and base of the pyramid market. Originality/value: Based on some emerging and attractive business practices in China, this paper offers a valuable attempt to theorize them as long tail phenomenon.

Design/methodology/approach: This exploratory study is qualitative in nature and utilizes semi-structured interviews at 14 African fintech firms. Findings: The study reveals that, during intra-Africa expansion, firms adapt their marketing strategies by working with local people, prioritizing customer education, creating personal relationships with customers, adapting their communication strategies and pricing strategies and using social media. The strategies that have been most effective involve including the community in the marketing process, prioritizing relationships, segmenting customers geographically, educating customers about products, using local distribution partners and having a flexible approach to strategy adaptation. Practical implications: It has been argued that technological innovation in Africa in areas such as financial services is a critical driver of its future development, because of the opportunity it presents to promote financial inclusion.

Various fintech services have a strategy to attract customers. One of the strategies is to offer promos to potential customers or early customers. Promos given to customers will provide maximum benefits when they use accurate type of promo on a promo provided by fintech services. Knowledge of various fintech services and a lot of promo information will provide an effective alternative for customers to use promos. For this reason, applications or software have been developed to provide information on various e-money and e-wallet services and promos. The method used is Lean UX which consists of 4 stages namely declare assumpts, Develop MVP, run experiments, feedback and user research. The result obtained on this research is a mobile androide application that can display fintech and promo information. Lean UX development is done with 2 iterations and produces features that are validly needed by the user but still need development in terms of User Experience. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","","","","","","","","Edison, Henry, Lean Internal Startups for Software Product Innovation in Large Companies: Enablers and Inhibitors, Journal of Systems and Software, 135, pp. 69-87, (2018); Karamanis, Nikiforos, Designing an intuitive web application for drug discovery scientists, Drug Discovery Today, 23, 6, pp. 1169-1174, (2018); Nurdiani, Indira, The impacts of agile and lean practices on project constraints: A tertiary study, Journal of Systems and Software, 119, pp. 162-183, (2016); Bjork, Collin, Integrating Usability Testing with Digital Rhetoric in OWI, Computers and Composition, 49, pp. 4-13, (2018); Peruzzini, Margherita, How to analyse the workers’ experience in integrated product-process design, Journal of Industrial Information Integration, 12, pp. 31-46, (2018); Zimmerman, John, Speed Dating: Providing a Menu of Possible Futures, She Ji, 3, 1, pp. 30-50, (2017); Leung, Angela Ka Yee, Thinking through Design is Creative and Inspiring: The Why and How, She Ji, 3, 2, pp. 96-98, (2017); Lárusdóttir, Marta Kristín, A license to kill – Improving UCSD in Agile development, Journal of Systems and Software, 123, pp. 214-222, (2017); Brunnert, Andreas, Continuous performance evaluation and capacity planning using resource profiles for enterprise applications, Journal of Systems and Software, 123, pp. 239-262, (2017); Femmer, Henning, Rapid quality assurance with Requirements Smells, Journal of Systems and Software, 123, pp. 190-213, (2017)","","Abdullah, A.G.; Suhartanto, D.; Widiaty, I.; Aviasti; Agustina, I.H.; Usman, D.N.; Nugraha; Rompas, P.T.D.; Warouw, F.F.; Basyarudin, N.C.; Andriyanto; Sumeru; Abdullah, C.U.; Marham, S.; Alim, N.","Institute of Physics Publishing helen.craven@iop.org","","3rd International Conference on Innovation in Engineering and Vocational Education 2019, ICIEVE 2019","2019-11-26","Bandung, West Java","160463","17578981","","","","English","IOP Conf.

Then, the SFA model and single-stage estimation technique are used to measure the profit, cost efficiency and inefficiency influencing factors of commercial banks in Fintech environment. We also compare and analyze the evolution process of the efficiency of different types of commercial Banks. The research finds that, overall, the development of Fintech promotes the profitability of China's banking sector, but hinders the improvement of cost efficiency. The profit and cost efficiency of large state-owned banks are higher than that of small and medium-sized banks.

Open innovation between critical stakeholders in the emerging fintech industry brings about positive results to improve financing needs of this huge segment of the market that ranges from those underserved by banks because of credit risk, to migrants and refugees. Despite the introduction of disruptive fintech services, the needs generated by unimproved conditions and protracted crises outstrip the resources available to meet them. Islamic fintech has the potential to solve this problem through its mandatory (zakat), voluntary (waqf and sadaqah) philanthropic principles, as well as its encouragement to fostering the culture of science, technology, and advancement, in forming a steady pool of resources to enable financial inclusion. This research employs literature review, conceptual analysis and qualitative case study methodology to provide an overview of how fintech start-ups in Finland and Malaysia facilitate financial inclusion through the illustration of two major fintech sectors, namely e-marketplace/payments and crowdfunding/peer-to-peer (P2P) financing. We synthesize that open innovation further enhances fintech services to elevate social finance from its current infrastructure to a more sustainable outcome-base funding, changing the way capital could be mobilized for social impact. Our findings also suggest that Islamic fintech offers an effective and efficient alternative to raising funds in the backdrop of financing the underserved individuals, while providing a knowledge-based platform that enhances customer-service provider intimacy to guide future social finance decisions. © 2020 SERSC.","Financial inclusion; Fintech; Islamic fintech; Open innovation","","","","","","","In Malaysia, regulators have played an important role in opening up the ecosystem to support the growth of local fintech start-ups. The Malaysian central bank facilitates businesses and create encouraging environments like sandboxes for fintech start-ups to come in and test their services. Prompted by clear message of its digitisation targets for the financial industry, regulators in Malaysia have liberalised areas like insurance, alternative trading assistance, robo advisory and peer-to-peer lending. Although it can be seen as a double-edged sword, the fact that regulation gives consumers confidence should overcome the negative aura attached to the costs incurred due to regulation. Still, there are rooms for improvement. Ethis’s Umar Munshi said: “The going for start-ups are still at a slow pace though there have been various efforts undertaken by the regulators and authorities. The current efforts are fragmented. We need a synchronised, focused and specific initiative led by a specific government entity, or perhaps a special committee to drive the move.” Some of the agencies involved in regulating fintech are the Securities Commission Malaysia (SC), Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC), besides Malaysia’s central bank. Public sector funds should also be allocated for funding program so there will be innovation among Islamic fintech start-ups. Fintech has the potential to make Islamic finance a more attractive business as technology could generate better efficiency, reduce costs of operation and spur competitiveness.","Ahuja, Gautam, The duality of collaboration: Inducements and opportunities in the formation of interfirm linkages, Strategic Management Journal, 21, 3, pp. 317-343, (2000); Unsw Law Research Paper, (2019); Barras, Richard, Towards a theory of innovation in services, Research Policy, 15, 4, pp. 161-173, (1986); Barras, Richard, Interactive innovation in financial and business services: The vanguard of the service revolution, Research Policy, 19, 3, pp. 215-237, (1990); Journal of Developing Areas, (2007); Bateman, Milford, The role of microfinance in contemporary rural development finance policy and practice: Imposing neoliberalism as 'best practice, Journal of Agrarian Change, 12, 4, pp. 587-600, (2012); World Economic Review, (2012); Bateman, Milford, Is fin-tech the new panacea for poverty alleviation and local development?

The rise of fintech driven by nonbank entities (technology startups, finance, big tech and big retail companies) helps to transform financial services industry, but also threatens the market positions of traditional banks and through them potentially the stability of the financial system. The current EU proposals, as presented in the Commission’s Fintech Action Plan published in 2018 and follow-up measures, outlined a number of steps to support fintech, while ensuring the protection of market stability and consumers and the maintenance of level playing field in the financial services markets. The article argues that, while the Commission’s proposed policy mix contains certain positive measures for fintech, it remains, overall, conservative and favours the incumbents. It also argues that unless the Commission becomes bolder and adopts a more flexible legal framework for fintech (for which the article makes specific recommendations), the latter will not grow at the pace needed to help build a competitive advantage for the EU financial sector. The Commission’s continuing support of the established market landscape dominated by financial conglomerates employing traditional business models risks undermining the ability of the European financial system to adapt to the changing competition landscape created by advancing financial technologies and to fully address stability concerns, which emerged as a result of the financial crisis ©2020 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands","artificial intelligence; big data; crowdfunding; crypto-assets; EU; fintech; GDPR; plan; regtech; regulation","","","","","","","","His Research Interests Include Banking Finance Law Law of Information Technology Commercial Law Law of Sustainable Development and Competition Law; 150 Years of Fintech an Evolutionary Analysis; Bis Quarterly Review, (2018); undefined; Impact of Digital Innovation on the Processing of Electronic Payments and Contracting an Overview of Legal Risks, (2017); Own Initiative Report on Initial Coin Offerings and Crypto Assets Advice to Esma, (2018); Global Monitoring Report on Non Bank Financial Intermediation 2018, (2019); Stacey English and Susannah Hammond Cost of Compliance 2018, (2017); Global Bank Risk Management Survey Accelerating Digital Transformation Ninth Annual Ey Iif Survey; Competition Issues in the Area of Financial Technology Fintech Policy Department for Economic Scientific and Quality of Life Policies, (2018)","","","Kluwer Law International","","","","","","09596941","","","","English","Eur.

We identify a robust set of contractual loan characteristics, borrower characteristics, and macroeconomic variables that are important in determining the likelihood of default, such as loan maturity, homeownership, loan purposes, occupation, etc. We also find an important role of alternative data in determining the default, even after controlling for the obvious risk characteristics of the borrowers, loan characteristics, and the local economic factors. The results are robust to different empirical approaches. Results imply that it would be important for regulators to provide greater transparency in terms of guidance and regulatory clarity on which alternative data can be used legally without violating fair lending rules.

Research results on economic and environmental issues of green business management showed that there are several basic types of problems at present which arise at enterprises during collecting and processing data on the results of their activities. The authors analyzed how public sector and green business is catching up on global trend towards broader use of the big data analysis to serve public interests and increase efficiency of business activities. In order to detect current approach to big data analysis in public and private sectors authors conduct interviews with stakeholders. The paper concludes with the analysis what changes in approaches to the big data analysis in public and private sectors have to be made in order to comply with the global trends in greening the economy. Application of FinTech, methods of processing large data sets and tools for implementing the principles of greening the economy will enable to increase the investment attractiveness of green business and will simplify the interaction between the state and enterprises. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.","","Big data; Economics; Fintech; Information analysis; Investments; Sustainable development; Business activities; Economic activities; Environment pollution; Environmental issues; Investment attractiveness; Public and private sector; Public interest; Research results; Data handling","","","","","","","Renewables 2015 Global Status Report, (2015); Renewables 2019 Global Status Report Ren21 Secretariat Paris 2019; Boyd, Danah Michele, Critical questions for big data: Provocations for a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon, Information Communication and Society, 15, 5, pp. 662-679, (2012); Hidden Biases in Big Data, (2013); Desouza-, Kevin C., Big Data in the Public Sector: Lessons for Practitioners and Scholars, Administration and Society, 49, 7, pp. 1043-1064, (2017); Kim, Ganghoon, Big-data applications in the government sector, Communications of the ACM, 57, 3, pp. 78-85, (2014); Mervis, Jeffrey D., U.S. science policy: Agencies rally to tackle big data, Science, 335, 6077, (2012); Mechanisms for Financing Green Projects Country Experience Cur Iss of Econ and Law, (2017); Akaike, Hirotsugu, A New Look at the Statistical Model Identification, IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 19, 6, pp. 716-723, (1974); Annals of Statistics, (1978)","T.

This also applies to the financial sector of the economy. Since the mid-2000s, new fintech companies have entered the market. These companies are using new technologies to improve existing and create new financial services. In the course of their development, the interests of new market entrants often overlap with those of traditional participants, mainly banks. Investigation of the relations between fintech companies and traditional financial institutions gives an opportunity to form an idea of the financial picture of the near future. The research of the relations between fintech companies and traditional financial institutions gives an opportunity to form an idea of the financial picture of the near future. The article considers both aspects of competition and aspects of possible cooperation between financial market participants in a digital economy. The results of the scientific research demonstrate that cooperation will prevail over the competition. Probably existing financial institutions will reformat their architecture and become digital ones at the core. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.","","Commerce; Sustainable development; Competition and cooperation; Digital economy; Digital technologies; Financial institution; Financial sectors; Financial service; Market participants; Scientific researches; Fintech","","","","","","","Global Analysis of Investment in Fintech Pulse of Fintech 2018 Kpmg International 9 July, (2018); Global Analysis of Investment in Fintech Pulse of Fintech 2019 Kpmg International 30 July, (2019); Biannual Global Analysis of Investment in Fintech Pulse of Fintech 2019 31 July, (2019); Zachem Kitajskij Strahovshhik Ping an Insurance Investiruet 22 Mlrd V Razlichnye Startapy Why Chinese Insurer Ping an Insurance Invests 22 Billion in Various Startups, (2019); Global Fintech Report Q2 2019; Fintech Market Accelerating the Development of Ecommerce Industry; 79 Key Fintech Statistics 2019 2020 Market Share Data Analysis, (2019); Usi Fintekh Kompaniji Ukrajiny Pochynajuchy Z 1991 Roku all Fintech Companies in Ukraine Since 1991, (2019); Financial Stability Report, (2019); Valueweb Kak Finteh Kompanii Ispol Zujut Blokchejn I Mobil Nye Tehnologii Dlja Sozdanija Interneta Cnnostej Valueweb how Fintech Firms are Using Bitcoin Blockchain and Mobile Technologies to Create the Internet of Value, (2018)","A.

Design/methodology/approach: Rooted in the philosophical foundations of “use-inspired research,” this paper addresses the managerially and societally relevant phenomenon of Fintech by identifying, and responding to, the individual challenges and problems associated with the digital transformation of financial services. This is accomplished through a computational text-mining approach to analyze the corpus of 1,545 published practitioner articles associated with Fintech, identification of managerial challenges therein and subsequent delineation of a novel research agenda. Findings: By connecting managerial challenges relating to Fintech with the service literature, this paper develops a use-inspired research agenda that provides scholarly and managerially relevant research directions (RDs). These pertain to the complexity of digital financial service systems (micro level), orchestration of value co-creation with Fintech (meso level), and the development of elastic infrastructures, models and markets (macro level). Research limitations/implications: Fintech is an emerging phenomenon associated with the digital transformation of financial services. However, actual guidelines on how service research related to Fintech could be advanced from a theoretically as well as managerially relevant angle are unavailable to date. Here, the authors address this challenge and provide the field with 18 tangible RDs to advance service theory and practice. Practical implications: The purpose of this paper is to guide future academic research addressing managerial challenges associated with Fintech and the digital transformation of financial service. Due to the explicit use-inspired nature of the work, the future research stemming from the agenda that the authors put forward here will be of benefit to decision makers and society more broadly. Originality/value: This empirical research contributes to the discourse regarding the role of information and communication technologies in service in general, and the digital transformation on financial services in particular. The in-depth computational text-mining analysis is unbiased, replicable and provides the foundation for a use-inspired research agenda that is subsequently delineated. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Digital transformation; Financial service systems; Fintech; Text mining","","","","","","Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, MOTIE, (20184010201680); Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, MOTIE; Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning, KETEP","Authors are listed alphabetically and have contributed equally to this paper.

However, such service is not familiar among the marginalised people as it involves technology and cost. Scheduled tribes in India have been viewed as the most distraught social group subject to age-old financial and social hardships. Financial literacy on financial services has been shown to be a crucial factor in making effective decisions and choices regarding finance. This paper tries to examine both overall and category wise financial literacy of scheduled tribes in Kerala with special emphasis on gender. It uses primary data of 393 tribal respondents from seven tribal communities across the most three tribally populated districts. It observed that, there are disarrays in the use of fintech services among tribes. The tribal community has not been able to find satisfactory literacy in fintech services. But they have a healthy knowledge on other basic financial and banking services, and women often outperform men in this regard. © 2020 SERSC.","Banking Services; Financial literacy; Financial Services; Fintech; Tribes","","","","","","University Grants Committee, UGC","Jins Varkey is working as Assistant Professor in the Department of Economics, St. Aloysius College, Kerala, India.

It offers a five-part taxonomy of (i) the key fintech-driven changes in the structure and operation of today's financial system, and (ii) the corresponding challenges these systemic shifts pose to the continuing efficacy of the regulatory enterprise as it exists today. This exercise reveals the fundamental tension at the core of the fintech problem. In the fintech era, the financial system as a whole is growing ever bigger, moving ever faster, and getting ever more complex and difficult to manage. The emerging regulatory responses to these macro-level changes, however, continue to operate primarily on the micro-level. Surveying the presently fragmented efforts to regulate fintech, this article highlights the limiting effects of the technocratic bias built into their design. Against that background, it outlines several alternative reform options that would explicitly target the core macro-structural, as opposed to micro-transactional, aspects of the fintech challenge- A nd do so in a more assertive, comprehensive, and normatively unified manner. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

In conditions of a gradual transition to project financing of housing construction, developers and banks face with the problem of the deficite of resources to finance all new buildings and the completion of projects. The project financing mechanism remains incompletely developed; only the basic principles of the project financing mechanism work are indicated. There is no regulatory legal framework, so it is difficult to evaluate these initiatives. The Russian banking system is not ready to fully provide loans at the request of housing developers, because it does not have sufficient financial resources. Banking products using escrow accounts are in the formation stage, which is of interest in considering other forms of financing of construction objects, in particular, using the crowdfunding technology, the possibilities and advantages of which are discussed in a scientific article. The technology of crowdfunding can be used by commercial banks by creating an Internet site for attracting public funds to implement a targeted project online. Previously, the bank's task is to assess the reality, effectiveness and timing of the project in order to reduce risks. In the future, the bank collects online funds and their investment in the project. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","","","","","","","","Crowdfunding Essence Advantages and Risks Journal Modern Science Actual Problems of Theory and Practice; Journal Bulletin of Voronezh State University of Engineering Technologies, (2016); Journal Economics and Management Scientific and Practical Journal, (2018); Volume of the Crowdfunding Market in 2017 has Doubled Official Website of the Central Bank of Russia; Main Directions of Development of Financial Technologies for the Period 2018 2020 Official Website of the Central Bank of Russia; Problems and Prospects of Project Financing of the Construction Complex of Russia; Project Financing in the Field of Housing Construction can Be Earned as Early as July 1, (2018)","","Solovev, D.B.","Institute of Physics Publishing helen.craven@iop.org","","International Science and Technology Conference on FarEastCon-2019, FarEastCon 2019","2019-10-01 through 2019-10-04","Vladivostok, Russky Island","158130","17578981","","","","English","IOP Conf.

This seismic shift in investor base has been coupled with significant growth for the legacy P2P lenders and new entrants. A new regulatory approach is needed to grapple with these changes-one that focuses on consumer protection, as opposed to one that seeks to protect the sophisticated investors purchasing these loans. Fortunately, such an approach is readily available in the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's fintech charter. This Comment surveys the significant changes that have occurred in the P2P lending sector over the past ten years, as well as the risks and benefits to consumers attendant to the rapid growth in this relatively new form of lending. After surveying the current and proposed regulatory approaches toward P2P lending, this Comment explains why a national fintech charter is the best approach to ensuring that consumers who rely on these loans receive the full protections guaranteed by federal law. © 2020 University of Pennsylvania Law School.

The literature and blog space to date have indicated that digital wallets could overtake the need for traditional banking. The purpose of this article is to provide further testing on whether FinTech banking companies could overtake the need for traditional banking by evaluating whether the number of deposits at various US commercial banks and the growth of digital wallets have impacted US commercial bank market values over the past two to three years. Results indicate a strong positive relationship between the number of deposits and US commercial bank market values and a strong negative relationship between digital wallet proxy measures and US commercial bank market values from 2017 to 2019. The trends indicate a stable amount of deposit in the US banking system to a slight decline versus a large growth in the digital wallet sphere. Results indicate that digital wallets could create a large decrease in the market value of commercial banks in the future.

It is potentially one of the game changing disruptive forces which have transformed the financial ecosystem leveraging the throughput of banking and financial services. The advent of financial technology has given much needed impetus to the otherwise struggling financial institutions, which have been able to cut down a lot on redundant costs. Resultantly, the institutions have been able to maximise operating efficiency and reduce costs to a large extent. The technology backed financial landscape has been improved over a period of time with results being evident in its profitability and other allied ratios.

The full potential of FinTech to support the SDGs may be realized with a progressive approach to the development of underlying infrastructure to support digital financial transformation. Our research suggests that the best way to think about such a strategy is to focus on four primary pillars. The first pillar requires the building of digital identity, simplified account opening and e-KYC systems, supported by the second pillar of open interoperable electronic payments systems. The third pillar involves using the infrastructure of the first and second pillars to underpin electronic provision of government services and payments. The fourth pillar—design of digital financial markets and systems—supports broader access to finance and investment. Implementing the four pillars is a major journey for any economy, but one which has tremendous potential to transform not only finance but economies and societies, through FinTech, financial inclusion and sustainable balanced development. © 2020, T.M.C.

One way to handle these is to adopt a streaming setting where data are only available to the algorithms during a very short time. When a new data point (financial transaction) is generated, it needs to be processed directly, and be forgotten immediately after. Especially, ongoing globalization efforts in FinTech require modern methods of fault detection to be able to work efficiently through more than 10 000 financial transactions per second if they are to be deployed as a first line of defence. This article investigates two algorithms able to perform well in this demanding setting: K-means and FADO. Especially, this article provides supports for the claim that the use of multiple clusters does not necessarily translate into increased detection performance. To support this claim, results are reported when operating in a quasi-realistic case study of Anti Money Laundering (AML) detection in real-time payment systems. We focus on two prototypical algorithms: the passive aggressive FADO assuming a single cluster, and the well-known K-means algorithm working with K> clusters. We find-in this case-that the use of K-means with multiple clusters is unfavorable as 1) both tuning for K, as well as the need for additional complexity in the K-means algorithm challenges the computational constraints; 2) K-means introduces necessarily added variability (unreliability) in the results; 3) it requires dimensionality reduction, compromising interpretability of the detections; 4) the prevalence of singleton clusters adds unreliability to the outcome. This makes in the presented case FADO favorable over K-means (with K>1). © 2001-2011 IEEE.","artificial intelligence; filtering; fintech; Fraud detection","Anomaly detection; Approximation algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Clustering algorithms; Data streams; Dimensionality reduction; Fault detection; Filtration; Fintech; Intelligent systems; Reliability; Computational constraints; Detection performance; Financial transactions; Fraud detection; High frequency data; Interpretability; Modern applications; Multiple clusters; K-means clustering","","","","","","","Potluri, Sasanka, Accelerated deep neural networks for enhanced Intrusion Detection System, IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation, ETFA, 2016-November, (2016); Basseville, Michèle, Detecting changes in signals and systems-A survey, Automatica, 24, 3, pp. 309-326, (1988); Gupta, Manish K., Outlier Detection for Temporal Data: A Survey, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 26, 9, pp. 2250-2267, (2014); Chandola, Varun, Anomaly detection: A survey, ACM Computing Surveys, 41, 3, (2009); Credit Scoring and Credit Control, (2001); Abdallah, Aisha, Fraud detection system: A survey, Journal of Network and Computer Applications, 68, pp. 90-113, (2016); West, Jarrod, Intelligent financial fraud detection: A comprehensive review, Computers and Security, 57, pp. 47-66, (2016); Rettig, Laura, Online Anomaly Detection over Big Data Streams, pp. 289-312, (2019); Fado A Deterministic Detection Learning Algorithm Under Review, (2017); Jain, Anil K., Data clustering: A review, ACM Computing Surveys, 31, 3, pp. 264-323, (1999)","K.

The paper summarizes the research and findings in this emerging field. Thereafter, it identifies the gaps and provides directions for further research. Simultaneously, the paper collates technical terms related to FinTech that appear repeatedly in each category and explains them. Finally, the study highlights the lessons that growing FinTech firms and their regulators can learn from the experiences of their counterparts across the globe. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic review of literature consisting of 130 studies (social science research network [SSRN]-29 papers, Scopus-81, other sources-20) on FinTech is carried out in this thematic paper. Findings: This thematic paper divides FinTech into three themes, i.e. financial industry, innovation/technology and law/regulation. The paper suggests that a thorough impact of FinTech on various stakeholders can be understood using three dimensions, namely, consumers, market players and regulatory front. It is noted that FinTech is in its nascent phase and is undergoing continuous development and implementation through product and process innovation, disruption and transformation. Research limitations/implications: The paper reports that FinTech promises huge potential for further study by various stakeholders in the FinTech industry – from academia to practitioners to regulators. Practical implications: The paper summarizes lessons that could be of significance for FinTech users, producers, entrepreneurs, investors, policy designers and regulators. Originality/value: The paper is believed to add value to the understanding of FinTech in light of the emerging threats and opportunities for its various stakeholders. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Big data; Blockchain; Crowdfunding; Cryptocurrency; Entrepreneurial finance; FinTech; ICOs; Innovation; P2P lending; Regtech; Regulatory sandbox; Shadow banking","","","","","","","","Adhami, Saman, Why do businesses go crypto?

At the same time, most African economies continue to be at the tail end of global financial innovations adoption. Given lagging consumer adoption of cryptocurrency in South Africa, the purpose of this paper is to apply the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) to predict behavioural intention to adopt cryptocurrency. Design/methodology/approach: A survey instrument based on the TPB was used to collect quantitative data for predicting adoption from adult distance students at the Mancosa, Cape Town campus. For data analysis, the two-step structural equation modelling approach was used. Findings: The findings indicate that attitude and perceived behavioural control positively impact the intention to adopt cryptocurrency. Subjective norm showed a negative non-significant influence. Overall, the results of the study show that the model has a good model fit and can be used to explain the theory. Research limitations/implications: The results of this study may not be generalisable to the wider population as it is only based on a cross-sectional study of a sample of adult students at a single institute in South Africa. Originality/value: The contribution of this paper is threefold: it is one of a few studies on the behavioural intention to adopt cryptocurrency in South Africa using the TPB model, it contributes towards the use of predictive behavioural economics models in understanding consumer behaviour critical to accelerating the adoption of financial innovations, and the results of the study also inform behaviour change strategies that can be applied by practitioners or policymakers to improve adoption. Studies of this nature may lead to the development of financial innovation in emerging markets through a nuanced understanding of consumer behaviour. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bitcoin; Blockchain; Cryptocurrency; Financial technology innovation; South Africa; Theory of planned behaviour","","","","","","","","Aassve, Arnstein, Explaining attitudes towards demographic behaviour, European Sociological Review, 29, 2, pp. 316-333, (2013); Ajzen, Icek, Attitudes, traits, and actions: Dispositional prediction of behavior in personality and social psychology, Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 20, C, pp. 1-63, (1987); Attitudes Personality and Behavior, (1988); Ajzen, Icek, The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); Ajzen, Icek, Perceived behavioral control, self-efficacy, locus of control, and the theory of planned behavior, Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 32, 4, pp. 665-683, (2002); Ajzen, Icek, The theory of planned behaviour: Reactions and reflections, Psychology and Health, 26, 9, pp. 1113-1127, (2011); Ajzen, Icek, The theory of planned behavior, pp. 438-459, (2012); Ajzen, Icek, The theory of planned behaviour is alive and well, and not ready to retire: a commentary on Sniehotta, Presseau, and Araújo-Soares, Health Psychology Review, 9, 2, pp. 131-137, (2015); Understanding Attitudes and Predicting Social Behavior, (1980); Akhtar, Fatima, Predictors of investment intention in Indian stock markets: Extending the theory of planned behaviour, International Journal of Bank Marketing, 37, 1, pp. 97-119, (2019)","L.

With the rise of technologies such as big data and artificial intelligence in recent years, agent-based modeling and basic supporting technologies in the field of FinTech are deeply integrated to jointly promote continuous breakthroughs in FinTech. In particular, in the fields of big data ontology research, agent-based model calibration, investor behavior modeling, regulatory technology applications, etc., agent-based modeling has demonstrated its unique advantages in integrating with FinTech. From the perspectives of big data ontology, agent-based modeling is an effective method that uses financial big data ontology modeling to depict the correlation between financial entities and to study their causal relationships. From the perspectives of artificial intelligence, it provides the basis for fine modeling of individuals and behavioral evolution modeling, and agent-based modeling provides a new research frame-work for algorithmic trading. From the perspectives of regulatory technology, the agent-based model in the development process to promote the formation of a new 'scenario-response' type of risk management, thus providing supports for the 'regulatory technology' development.

The research paper starts from the reality that finance plays an important role in each economy. Nowadays, finance has to manage and adapt to Digital Era. The purpose of this paper is an attempt to identify and encourage managing financial statements through artificial intelligence using XBRL and Blockchain. In many countries, financial and tax authorities encourage the adoption of eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) and Blockchain. XBRL enable business to generate their required reporting information directly from their financial data. Blockchain technology continues to grow and it is being used in more and more business sectors. Finance, accounting and auditing has been identified as areas that could greatly benefit the distributed registry and other features of Blockchain. The main benefits generated by these innovative tools include reducing the risk of error (especially human error); low risk of fraud; system automation, big data analysis, huge cost savings (by increasing the efficiency and decreasing in errors), increased reliability in financial reports, and reduced workflow. The research paper comes to present how artificial intelligence combine financial information with tech capabilities, accelerate digital transformation of finance and accounting, and may create a more safety business and economic environment, reducing human error. We have to manage our work and time differently.

The rapid development of fintech in Indonesia was responded positively by the existence of several regulations issued by the Financial Services Authority (OJK) and Bank Indonesia (BI). Besides conventional fintech, sharia fintech in Indonesia has also begun to develop where the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) has issued a fatwa on Sharia-Based Information Technology-Based Financing Services (Fatwa No.117 / DSN-MUI / IX / 2018). Although sharia fintech has begun to develop, OJK has not accommodated the MUI Fatwa to be a binding regulation. This will give an impact on legal uncertainty regarding supervising of sharia fintech. Ironically, both conventional and sharia fintech become a tool of crime related to the misused of consumer personal data unlawfully. To answer the problem, the methodology used of this article is juridical-normative with qualitative approach. The result of this study is although there are some regulations both conventional and sharia fintech, there are still violations of the law that harm consumers such as approval, supervision, law enforcement including violation of consumer personal data and the culture. Those have an impact on legal uncertainty for consumers because there is no legal protection provided by the state. © 2019 SERSC.","Consumers and Legal Protection; Financial Technology; Personal Data","","","","","","","","Tumbuh Pesat 135 Perusahaan Fintech Kini Ada Di Indonesia; Raconteur, (2018); Proceeding of the 2nd Interational on Law and Justice Iclj Faculty of Sharia and Law Uin Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta Indonesia, (2018); Proceeding of the 4th Muzakarah Fiqh and Iternational Fiqh Conference Mfifc, (2018); Georgetown Journal of International Law, (2015); Ilmu Hukum, (2000); Perlindungan Hukum Bagi Rakyat Indonesia, (1987); American Law an Introduction, (1998); Diponegoro Law Journal, (2017); Pelaksanaan Pemberian Kredit Berbasis Tehnologi Informasi Oleh Fintech Kepada Pelaku Ukm, (2018)","","","Science and Engineering Research Support Society ijbsbt@sersc.org PO Box 5014Sandy Bay TAS 7005 Tasmania","","","","","","20054238","","","","English","Int.

Our result shows that loan and borrowers’ specific factors are significantly associated with the loan rate and loan default, although the relation could differ from one platform to another. Our empirical result shows that platforms focused on very small loan for microbusiness increase their interest rate after the introduction of formal regulation. It could be because of the increase of the borrowers requiring a very small amount of loan relatively much more than the number of lenders. The shortfall of supply then drives the increase in loan rate.

Design/methodology/approach: Ten countries from both financial systems have been selected based on the presence of Islamic finance and conventional finance in the country. Data was analyzed from year 2011 to 2017 and keeping the former as base year to measure the change in the population fraction. Findings: The findings found that Islamic finance countries are more inclusive in terms of financial inclusion and women are financially more empowered as compared to the counterpart. On the contrary, countries with conventional finance have a higher number of FinTech users. Research limitations/implications: The difference between the performances of two systems in terms of financial inclusion is relatively small; therefore, future studies should incorporate more indicators for financial inclusion.

Relying on the agency perspective of the shareholder, debtholder and societal governance in banks, this research examines the impact of financial technology innovation (FinTech) on banks' performance by enlightening the monitoring role of female independent directors. Design/methodology/approach: Relying on a sample of Italian banks observed during the period 2016–2020, the authors hand-collected data on the use of FinTech by considering (1) the in-house provisions of FinTech solutions, (2) the collaboration with external FinTech firms and (3) a combination of both measures. The authors run a panel data regression analysis with fixed effects, measuring bank performance through bank competitiveness and bank riskiness. Findings: The authors find that FinTech increases bank competitiveness in gathering money from depositors and that independent women on board mitigate the negative relationship between FinTech and the riskiness of banks' assets, ameliorating the conflicting interests among shareholders, debtholder and societal governance. Originality/value: This study emphasizes the complexities of bank governance when dealing with FinTech in the wider perspective of equity governance, debt governance and the societal governance spotlighting the importance of appointing female directors in independent positions to enhance the bright sides of financial innovation.

This study argues that the existence of banks as intermediaries due to transaction cost and asymmetrical information. In Islamic banking operation, fee-based income is a significant component of income derivation of providing services. The study postulates that Fintech has made access to financial services at a lower cost; hence reduce potential fee-based income for Islamic banks. This study applied panel data models from 2009 to 2016 on the dataset for Malaysia. The results provide empirical evidences on the impact of financial technology revolution on the banks’ income in Malaysia. The findings also indicated that different evidences on impact of financial technology revolution on the Islamic banks’ income and conventional banks for dual banking system. Islamic banks appear to significantly affect by the Fintech revolution due low penetration of online banking and larger banks are relatively invest more on the technology which result in cost saving and increase efficiency. However, Islamic banks should embrace with the paradigm shift and emergence of financial technology revolution promptly to prevent financial disintermediation and create value to their stakeholders. This study provides empirical evidences on the impact of financial technology and Islamic banks in a dual banking system.

Those developments have put consumers’ interest in the centre of financial services. The Brexit process has been another factor for increasing the attention of policymakers of European countries on Fintech development. Policymakers have to take into account new realities and adopt their policy following the trends. The ability to take a political leadership, involvement of political establishment, creating formal and informal administrative structures, and a spirit of cooperation among stakeholders are the main elements for the success of any political initiative. This chapter evaluates what kind of factors could define the country’s choice to make Fintech as one of the policy priorities and how Fintech could trigger reforms in other policy areas such as immigration, education, risk management, taxation, improvements in business climate for start-ups, ICT infrastructure, and financial literacy. Lithuanian experience has been taken as a case study for the analysis due to the pace of the developments of the Fintech eco-system. Since 2015, a number of Fintech companies in the country has doubled, Fintech programmes have been introduced in universities, business associations, and innovation, including blockchain technology, centres have been established, crowdfunding platforms have been included into public-private financial engineering schemes, and, last but not least, up to 4% of the world’s initial coin offerings (ICOs) have been initiated by Lithuanian entrepreneurs in 2017. Those facts prove that right political and administrative decisions could create a good basis for the development of a completely new eco-system of the economy. © 2020 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

Design/methodology/approach – This study uses field data from the Chongwe district of Zambia. The data were collected in 2019. Findings – The findings strongly suggest that (1) the factors that hinder access to credit and savings by the poor do not simply recede following the adoption of mobile money services and (2) that mobile money is not a silver bullet of ending financial exclusion but merely a tool which contributes to other financial inclusion strategies. Practical implications – This study argues that mobile money is winning the battle but losing the war – implying that the service is mainly used to transfer funds (OTC transactions) among users.

The dynamic features of financial markets and the innovation of complex financial products and services based on new technologies and business models have presented regulators with significant challenges. Specifically, how can regulators effectively scrutinise unprecedentedly large volumes of market data? Is ‘Regtech’, instruments developed by industry to assist regulators, able to strengthen private compliance with public regulation? Does an alternative approach which institutionalises public–private cooperation offer answers to these new regulatory challenges? Responding to these questions, we adopt an analytic approach that categorises innovations by the type of regulatory uncertainty they produce. Our findings indicate that different types of uncertainty are driving divergent responses at the national and European levels, leading to a mixture of regulatory trajectories: cooperation and competition, centralisation and fragmentation. © Adrienne Héritier and Magnus G.

The advent of Financial Technology, or FinTech, in banking has changed the landscape of firm-customer interactions and delivery of unique customer experiences. Revolutionary FinTech firms are using technology to design and offer novel services that proactively meet consumer needs of financial services in direct and valuable ways (Gomber et al. 2018). The disruptive innovation triggered by technology has pitted incumbent banks against the agile new entrants, such as challenger or digital-only banks and FinTech firms. Crucially, customer experience has emerged as the new competitive front for financial services. Banks can no longer compete on product, price or the number of physical branches they have. What wins customer over is innovative products, proactive approach, and convenience in interacting via wide variety of channels (EY Banking Survey 2016). Despite widespread media and industry interest in FinTechs’ increasing ability to provide superior customer experience, academic research on this issue is still in an embryonic stage. This research seeks to understand how FinTech firms are developing greater customer orientation by delivering superior customer experiences. Does FinTech-driven experience promote greater consumer trust and satisfaction, and does it have a positive impact on word-of-mouth? This research aims to inform the industry and marketing professionals in understanding how the acceptance of technology by customers is influencing their customer experience. Our research methodology aims to explore the perceptions of customers of various large banks through a survey questionnaire. The survey consist of statements related to the factors affecting acceptance of online banking (TAM), online consumer experience antecedents and statements related to the interaction between service provide and customers via technology. Findings will provide insights into how banks can formulate successful strategies to address emerging competitive threats. Our policy contribution is to inform the industry and marketing professionals in understanding how the acceptance of technology by customers is influencing their customer experience. This research joins ongoing regulatory dialogues (e.g. Australian Securities and Investment Commission, 2018; Chartered Banker Institute, 2018), which assert that despite an increasingly important role of technology, service staff still plays a key role in rendering superior customer experience in banking. This study aims to conduct a detailed analysis of the dynamic role played by employee- customer (Branch-level) and technology-customer (FinTech) interfaces. Are they complements or substitutes? Our findings will provide insights into how banks can formulate successful strategies to address emerging competitive threats. © 2020, The Academy of Marketing Science.","Customer experience; Customer journey; Customer satisfaction; Digital strategy; Financial services; FinTech; Trust","","","","","","","","","V.

The power of technology applicable fastly in Islamic financial technology (i-Fintech), as it expands access to mobile financial services. This is evidenced by the increasing number of customers who interact using technology, especially micro-entrepreneurs, who adopt the tools into their business models to tap into this opportunity to enhance their income. Therefore, it is imperative to examine the impact of i-fintech use in stabilising micro-entrepreneurs’ income. A quantitative technique was employed through the use of 120 questionnaires distributed to micro-entrepreneurs who had adopted i-fintech into their business. Using Amos and SEM models, the study indicates that crowdfunding, mobile money and peer-to-peer lending play a significant role in ensuring income sustainability for micro-entrepreneurs. The study also discusses both the theoretical and managerial implications in comprehending the determinants of sustainable income growth in Malaysia. The findings should help practitioners, researchers and regulators to have better understanding of the dynamics between the potential of i-fintech and sustainable income. © Islamic Monetary Economics and Finance.

But several phenomena happened on technological, social, and financial fronts in the second half of the last decade that led banks to ‘get their eyes off the ball’ and open the window for a whole new industrial sector to emerge, FinTech. This chapter analyses the phenomenon with the objective of answering: Why did FinTech emerge as an industrial sector, independent of banking? How is the FinTech industry organized and where does crowdfunding fit in? The chapter identifies three external forces that acted upon the banking system and created the conditions for the FinTech sector to emerge. It also looks at the FinTech sector from an industrial organization perspective and proposes a framework connecting financial services functionality and technological applications. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2020.","Alternative finance; Banking; Banking technology; Crowdfunding; ERP; Financial innovation; FinTech; Information and communications technology (ICT)","","","","","","","","Armbrust, Michael, A view of cloud computing, Communications of the ACM, 53, 4, pp. 50-58, (2010); Arner, Douglas W., FinTech, regTech, and the reconceptualization of financial regulation, Northwestern Journal of International Law and Business, 37, 3, pp. 373-415, (2017); Barkhuus, Louise, Empowerment through seamfulness: Smart phones in everyday life, Personal and Ubiquitous Computing, 15, 6, pp. 629-639, (2011); Kasetsart Journal of Social Sciences, (2017); Chen, Yan, Blockchain tokens and the potential democratization of entrepreneurship and innovation, Business Horizons, 61, 4, pp. 567-575, (2018); Bis Quarterly Review, (2018); E Commerce Adoption and Business Impact A Progress Report in Economic Trends ICT and Economic Growth Evidence from OECD Countries Industries and Firms, (2003); Cotton Iw, DATA STRUCTURES AND TECHNIQUES FOR REMOTE COMPUTER GRAPHICS, 33, pt 1, pp. 533-544, (1968); Fintech in Germany, (2017); Duan, Lian, Business intelligence for enterprise systems: A survey, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 8, 3, pp. 679-687, (2012)","P.

A number of issues arise: which are the value chain participants that will be ultimately subject to regulation? Who is the competent regulator from a sectoral point of view? How will the geographic scope of each national regulator’s powers be delineated, considering the global character of FinTech services? What should be the appropriate regulatory tools and methods to be applied? These issues are outlined in Sect. 1. A number of international organizations and fora are approaching and examining the FinTech/ InsurTech phenomenon, to assess its possible benefits and implications for the regulated markets. The activities undertaken by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) are briefly presented in Sect. 2. From a European perspective, EU authorities and institutions, including the three European Supervisory Authorities (EIOPA, EBA, and ESMA) also undertake initiatives, targeted at better comprehending the FinTech/ InsurTech phenomenon, as described in Sect. 3. Finally, there are a number of national regulators who are proactive on the national level and undertake measures aiming to foster technological innovation, in the provision of financial and insurance services, as mentioned in Sect. 4. The regulatory activity is evolving very fast. It is still in a rather preliminary phase, but a large amount of new rules is expected to be produced within the next 2 or 3 years. © 2020, The Author(s).","","","","","","","","","Transportation Research Part B Methodological, (2013); Transportation Research Part B Methodological, (2013); Transportation Research Part B Methodological, (2014); Available at, (2017); Third Financial Innovation Day, (2017); Responses to the Commissions Public Consultation on Fintech, (2017); Transportation Research Part B Methodological, (2013); Transportation Research Part B Methodological, (2013); Technology and Innovation in the Insurance Sector, (2017); Transportation Research Part B Methodological, (2013)","V.

Then, we talk about how to combine the emerging blockchain technology with intelligent regulatory sandbox, thus solving problems such as poor data flow and regulation sluggish.

We address the research question: “how do fintech firms address financial inclusion?” Informed through activity theory, our preliminary findings show that fintech firms act as innovators and aggregators, leverage existing infrastructure of incumbents and deploy cooperative strategies comprising elements of competition and cooperation to address financial inclusion. Based on the findings, this study develops a fintech driven financial inclusion model that explains how fintech firms work towards addressing financial inclusion. © ICIS 2020.

Banks are increasingly using financial technologies, or “fintech, "" to deliver products and services and maximize their profits. Technology enthusiasts and some consumer advocates laude fintech for its potential to expand access to banking and finance. If history is any indication, however, fintech stands to reinforce digital forms of redlining and enable banks’ continued racialized exploitation of Black and Brown communities. Banking on a Revolution takes the perspective that the financial system needs a revolution-and not the impending revolution driven by technology. Studying various ways the financial system advantages whites by exploiting and marginalizing Black and Brown communities, Terri Friedline challenges the optimistic belief that fintech can expand access to banking and finance. Friedline applies the lens of financialized racial neoliberal capitalism to demonstrate the financial system’s inherent racism, and explores examples from student loan debt, corporate landlords, community benefits agreements, and banking and payday lending. She makes the case that the financial system needs a people-led revolution that centers the needs, experiences, and perspectives of those it has historically excluded, marginalized, and exploited. © Oxford University Press 2021.","Banks; Finance; Financial technologies; Financialization; Fintech; Racial capitalism; Racism; Redlining; Social movements","","","","","","","","Financialization of Housing A Political Economy Approach, (2016); Effects of the 1930s Holc Redlining Maps, (2017); Next City, (2017); Next City, (2019); New Rules for the 21st Century Corporate Power Public Power and the Future of the American Economy, (2019); Abramovitch, Rona, Children and money: getting an allowance, credit versus cash, and knowledge of pricing*, Journal of Economic Psychology, 12, 1, pp. 27-45, (1991); Abramovitz, Mimi, Privatization in the human services: The impact on the front lines and the ground floor, pp. 182-200, (2016); Atlanta Black Star, (2013); Kcet City Rising, (2017); Revolution Televised Prime Time and the Struggle for Black Power, (2004)","","","Oxford University Press","","","","","","","9780190944131","","","English","Bank. on a Revolution: Why Financial Technology Won't Save a Broken System","Book","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102208714"

This study seeks to measure Fintech’s usefulness, its growth and identify its determinants in a panel of three emerging, twenty-four frontiers and five fragile African markets for the period 2004–2018. A dummy variable interactive equation was modelled based on theory to account for heterogeneity between groups. Results from the system Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) estimation technique reveal that on average, Fintech usefulness in Africa is a dynamic heterogeneous process. Income per person, level of financial development, Fintechs’ compatibility with users’ experiences, users’ risk perception, inflation rate and financial-openness were the main determinants of its usefulness. Its rapid growth after the 2009 financial crisis suggests that greater Fintech usefulness can mitigate financial crisis among Africa markets. In particular, the growth of Mobile-banking, ATM and Internet-banking as at 2018 are on average 41.8%, 0.4%, and 20.8% respectively greater than its average in the base year 2004. The study concludes that Fintech’s usefulness is driven by economic, financial and psychological factors; therefore, structural transformation, financial development and improved literacy were recommended. © 2021 The Author(s).

Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses both primary and secondary data. Interviews of several executives of a FinTech lending firm are done to gain direct insight of how the firms strategize their business operation. On the other hand, secondary data from internet search (e.g., OJK’s Website, FinTech Lending firm’s websites) are used to grasp the overview of the industrial landscape. Findings: The study confirms that differentiation, collaboration, compliance and strong internal resources (e.g. team and funding) are the most pivotal elements for FinTech lending success. The study also confirmed the FinTech lending industrial landscape as an emerging and fragmented industry. Research limitations/implications: This paper offers an original and detailed solution about how the FinTech lending company strategies may survive in a dynamic competition. The paper also shows the industrial analysis of the FinTech lending industry, which is rarely discussed in previous research. However, this study only focused on the lending sub-sector of FinTech, and the sample for primary data is highly limited (only three interviews). Practical implications: This paper proposes a strategy that can be conducted by FinTech lending companies to achieve their business goals, including business growth, profits and improve financial inclusion in Indonesia. This perspective can act as a means to create practical modus operandi for policymakers and practitioners, especially FinTech lending companies in Indonesia. Originality/value: This paper offers an original and detailed solution about how the FinTech lending company strategies may survive in adynamic competition. This study also provides a theoretical framework for use in further empirical research into the process of resource mobilization from FinTech lending Indonesia companies. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Digitalization; FinTech; Indonesia; Industrial analysis; Lending","","","","","","Universitas Indonesia, UI, (NKB-0813/UN2.R3.1/HKP.05.00/2019); Universitas Indonesia, UI","Respondent C “ […] I think talent and funding are the most important factors.

The emergence of phenomena such as cryptocurrencies, blockchain transactions, fintech companies, and others modify the financial services market, which is traditionally dominated by banks and other large-scale financial organizations. To maintain their position in this highly dynamic environment, organizations offering financial services need to constantly adapt to modern information technologies and seek new approaches to connect with the end users through the digitalization of their activities. The list of tools offered by us does not claim to be exhaustive and rather indicates opportunities, coverage of tasks, possible diversity. The individual virtual tools are suitable for certain phases of the process of working in start-up fintech companies. It is a matter of the entrepreneur's discretion which of these and how convenient they are for a given product, idea, and business model. In terms of price, most tools have zero or low price - free versions, free for micro teams (up to 5-10 users) or the price is according to the number of users or volume of consumption. This is a convenience for a start-up company, as it implies low operating costs. A significant problem could be the large number and variety of tools to use. Many products have features that cover more than one activity and/or can be integrated with third-party tools for other activities, which makes it easier to build an integrated start-up environment. © 2020 International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

The results show that subjective and objective financial literacy have positive effects on financial market participation. Subjective and objective financial literacy have negative direct effects on insurance market participation. Subjective financial literacy plays an incomplete mediating effect in the impact of objective financial literacy on financial market and insurance market participation. Objective financial literacy is adjusted by subjective financial literacy on financial market participation and insurance market participation.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors use Pesaran et al.’s (2001) autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds test approach to cointegration to estimate the long-run relationship between four direct measures of financial technology (automated teller machine [ATM], Internet banking [IB], point of sale [POS] and mobile banking [MB]) and cash holding. Findings: The authors find the presence of long-run negative relationship between cash holding and the four direct measures of financial technology. Practical implications: Despite the negative effect of financial technology on cash holding, the descriptive results highlight increasing trajectory in cash holding. This suggests that structural factors such as ethical climate, literacy level, household characteristics, currency denomination structures, economic uncertainty and infrastructure deficit may account for the pervasive cash transactions in Nigeria and not necessarily the unwillingness of economic agents to use digital platform for financial transactions.

The study adopted descriptive research using a qualitative approach. Sources of data were obtained through literature studies, including published research results and expert opinions. The study results found that the presence of the fintech industry would easily overcome some of the problems that MSMEs often face. MSMEs were fast-growing and developing because they could optimize the fintech platform according to their needs. This study illustrates the services provided by fintech companies as being able to be a catalyst in the growth of their businesses. Services that specifically catalyze MSME growth in Indonesia include the Peer to Peer (P2P) Lending platform, equity crowdfunding (ECF), e-wallet, and personal finance. This research's implications include that MSME actors experience several benefits, such as effectiveness in finding sources of funds, ease of transaction processing, expanding market access, and faster preparation of financial reports. © 2020, Academy of Strategic Management Journal.

Design/methodology/approach: By using on a dataset from 46 countries between 2009 and 2018, the authors use five measures of VaR to investigate their empirical dynamics in relation with the market value of Fintech and non-Fintech companies. Findings: The empirical results indicate that Fintech firms' portfolios have a higher financial risk and a higher market value in comparison to non-fintech firms' portfolios. Furthermore, the authors also report that the Fintech firm portfolios experience more financial risk regardless of the holding period as long-term (one year) or short-term (quarter). Research limitations/implications: There are some limitations in this research. This research does not segregate Fintech firms into their different types of services, such as direct financial investment services, loan provision services, insurance services (InsurTech), etc. The authors only aggregate the Fintech firms by country and region. Future research may consider analysing Fintech firms by differentiating the kind of financial services they offer Practical implications: Given the importance of their market value, the results imply that Fintech companies might contribute significantly to financial fluctuations in case of large variations of the market. In terms of policy recommendation, this observation requires a particular attention from the regulatory bodies who need to find the best economic balance between promoting innovation/financial technology and regulating the Fintech companies. Originality/value: This paper is the first study clarifying the relation of financial risk and market value for the Fintech firms, using the large enough database to obtain significant results.

Riba or interest arises when foreign currencies are bought and sold at different rates. From the Islamic perspective, the difference between the buying and selling rates of foreign exchange will constitute Riba. Also, this paper examines the effects of eliminating such Riba on major macroeconomic variables. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on the hadith which imply that if buying and selling rates of currencies or foreign exchanges are same, i.e. if one sells BD1 = Dh10 and Dh10 = BD1 on spot, there will be no Riba. This can be guaranteed if the Islamic banking system introduces the technology, often known as FinTech interest-free foreign exchange bank machines (IFfexBM), which will automatically dispense BD10 for Dh100 and vice-versa, both locally and globally, and it will have tremendous positive effects in the economy. Furthermore, the effects of introducing FinTech for eliminating Riba will be analyzed on economic and international trade activities by using aggregate expenditure (AE) and aggregate output model within the tenets of Islamic principles. Findings: If Islamic banks (IBs) can introduce FinTech global network system where any client can buy or sell foreign currency at the same rate without any markup, it will increase the market share for IBs by increasing the number of customers and number of branches, and it will increase the inflow of funds and volumes of transactions, especially in international trade, global financial transactions and cross-border shopping. Such an increase in transactions will increase AE and AE will continuously shift up. Such an upward shift will have positive effects on equilibrium output, employment and prosperity. Originality/value: This is, perhaps, one of the latest attempts to eliminate Riba from foreign exchange transactions by introducing FinTech IFfexBM in each and every locality. Such elimination of Riba will not only reduce the cost of cross-border transactions but it will also reduce cost in international trade and financial transactions among nations, and therefore, it will have expansionary effects on equilibrium output, employment and global prosperity. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","FinTech; Foreign currency transactions; Full employment; Interest-free foreign exchange bank machines; International trade and financial transactions; Riba","","","","","","","","Abozaid, Abdulazeem Jalal, Does shariah recognize cryptocurrencies as valid currencies?, pp. 174-191, (2019); Agheli, Lotfali, Impact of information and communication technology on transport among the selected Middle East countries, Journal of Economic Cooperation and Development, 39, 1, pp. 1-18, (2018); Al Iqtishad Journal of Islamic Economics, (2018); Ajouz, Mousa, Acceptance of Sharīʿah-compliant precious metal-backed cryptocurrency as an alternative currency: An empirical validation of adoption of innovation theory, Thunderbird International Business Review, 62, 2, pp. 171-181, (2020); Fintech and Islamic Finance, (2019); Fintech in Islamic Finance Theory and Practice, (2019); Journal of King Abdulaziz University Islamic Economics, (2006); Barata, Amrin, STRENGTHENING NATIONAL ECONOMIC GROWTH AND EQUITABLE INCOME THROUGH SHARIA DIGITAL ECONOMY IN INDONESIA, Journal of Islamic Monetary Economics and Finance, 5, 1, pp. 145-168, (2019); Islamic Social Finance, (2018); Fintech in Islamic Finance, (2019)","M.

FinTech has a multi-dimension scope that missing in the traditional financial industry with the ability to alter the world's financial expectations and reality. Countries worldwide racing in this field to be the leader of this massive industry with the aim of continues development and progress, investing in FinTech's R&D will determine the leaders and winners of this industry. The aim of this paper is to explore the importance and the impact of FinTech on Bahrain's Banking sectors and to examine to what level the FinTech industry growth has reached since its inception. During 2018 only Bahrain we able to raise more than 100 million dollars in funding FinTech development, which represent a huge amount compared to Bahrain's GDB. In addition, regulators contributed efforts in providing a free space for investors and creators to test their products before applying it in the real market, which gives investors a good idea to project the cost and profit of operating in the region's FinTech industry, resulting in gaining investors trust in Bah- rain economy.

The research question of how to make blockchain be able to deal with various data types has not been well studied. In this paper, we propose a single-chain based extension model of blockchain for fintech (SEBF). In the financial environment, we design a four-layer architecture for this model. By employing the external trusted oracle group and a financial regulator agency, a variety types of data can be effectively stored in the blockchain, such that the data type extension based on a single-chain is realized. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model can improve the efficiency of simplified payment verification. © 2020 Inst. Sci. inf., Univ. Defence in Belgrade.

Therefore this research needs to be done to observe the potential of fintech in integrating MSMEs in terms of the application of technology and knowledge from the community related to fintech. By using Technology Acceptance Model, this research tries to understand the determinant factors of the fintech application used by MSME. Based on the research framework and model, path analysis method used in this research. This research uses primary data gathered by the questioner, which was distributed to MSME. From the analysis conducted, we can conclude that the external factors tested in this research could have an effect on the behaviour intention through perceived usefulness in MSME practice of financial technology. Large variation in MSME educational background, busineess age and size would become a challenge in promoting fintech application, therefore this finding suggests that fintech should be promoted by highlighting what benefits can be obtained by using fintech application. © 2020.

To identify them, we used the scenario approach. We determined three main development scenarios for the market of innovative financial technologies — “domination of traditional financial companies”, “segmentation of market of new financial technologies’, and “domination of digital financial companies” in terms of their probability and possible consequences for the global financial markets. The results of analysis allowed us to suggest that among main scenarios of fintech development the most probable is the splitting of existing market, which in the future can turn into a market of digital transnational financial corporations, which will squeeze out both small companies and traditional financial giants. However, although the scenario of capturing the financial market by large players is currently unlikely, it is certainly more important in terms of the consequences for global markets. The main prerequisite for the latter scenario is the promotion of international cooperation in the regulation of digital financial companies. Such a condition requires new models of country-level interaction in the regulation of innovative financial companies in order to address the risks and challenges of different scenarios of fintech development on global financial markets. This article includes a comparative analysis of digital development in Russia and the Republic of Korea, which is one of the key players on the Asian fintech market, as a possible benchmark that can be used to shape the policies of intergovernmental cooperation on global financial markets. These policies include 1) regulatory cooperation that reduces risks due to growing experience in the regulation of innovative financial companies; 2)cooperation in investments that allow one to acquire additional experience in regulatory practices and to develop infrastructure, which meets the new requirements of digital finance; and 3) cooperation in the taxation of fintech companies that reduces cross-border regulatory arbitrage. © 2020 by the authors.","Comparative analysis; Digital economy; Finance; Financial inclusion; Fintech; Global financial markets; International cooperation; Investment; Regulation; Regulation; Republic of Korea; Risks; Russian Federation; Scenario approach","","","","","","Russian Foundation for Basic Research, РФФИ, (20-010-00785); Russian Foundation for Basic Research, РФФИ","This study was carried out with the financial support of the Russian Foundation for Basic Research in the frame-work of the research project No. 20-010-00785 “Digital financial technologies as a factor in the development of the insurance market in the Russian Federation”.","Scenarios as Tools for International Environmental Assessments, (2001); Report for the VII Annual Meeting of the Working Group on Trade and Competition of Latin American and the Caribbean Wgtc, (2017); South South Digital Cooperation for Industrialization A Regional Integration Agenda Unctad Gds Ecidc 2018 1, (2018); Brics Digital Cooperation for Industrialization, (2019); Börjeson, Lena, Scenario types and techniques: Towards a user's guide, Futures, 38, 7, pp. 723-739, (2006); Meissner, Dirk, Understanding cross border innovation activities: The linkages between innovation modes, product architecture and firm boundaries, Journal of Business Research, 128, pp. 762-769, (2021); Future of Finance is Emerging New Hubs New Landscapes, (2018); Deploying Foresight for Policy and Strategy Makers Creating Opportunities Through Public Policies and Corporate Strategies in Science Technology and Innovation, (2016); Private Fintech as A Tool for Sustainable Business Development in Russia and Kazakhstan, (2018); Global Findex Database 2017 Measuring Financial Inclusion and the Fintech Revolution, (2018)","","","National Research University, Higher School of Econoimics","","","","","","25002597","","","","English","Foresight STI Gov.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096405779"

Specifically, the chapter investigates the role of disruptive financial technology in financial inclusion, focusing on mobile money transactions on entrepreneurship. Looking at the role of digital money on entrepreneurship matters greatly because self-employment is a sustainable route out of poverty. The study shows that the use of mobile money technology is not necessarily for investment purposes and to make livelihood changes by investing in the creation of new enterprises or self-employment ventures. Most of the current use of mobile money is for transaction payments, such as utility bills and/or payment of fees, like tuition fees. © 2020, The Author(s).","Burkina Faso; Disruptive financial technology; Entrepreneurship; Financial inclusion","","","","","","World Bank Group, WBG","A good deal of mobile money transaction users might be financial liter - ate but might be prevented by infrastructural bottlenecks (e.g. remote rural locations). However, when one looks at the national reporting average number of minutes that individuals spend to get to a mobile money agent, it is only 20 minutes. Hence, we cannot rule out the presence of a fair degree of ignorance or there are other complex factors at work that need to be explored. Part of the recent support from the World Bank is aimed at funding nationwide financial education campaigns via mobile phones for a six-year period (2019–2025) to reach 200,000 by the end of the funding cycle. If only 40% of the population is using a mobile phone, the education campaign is set to benefit a great proportion of the adult population. Alternative ways of delivering the education campaign need to be devised to reach the digitally excluded for reasons other than awareness (infrastructure barriers).","Global Entrepreneurship and Development Index 2014, (2016); Bateman, Milford, Is fin-tech the new panacea for poverty alleviation and local development?

In the case of peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, we highlight the role of consumers’ distrust in banks. We offer evidence that distrust in banks likely triggers individuals to supply funding toward crowdfunding and away from bank deposits. We highlight that a distrust mindset promotes questioning default choices and considering alternatives, and fosters comparisons focusing on dissimilarities. Our findings suggest US states whose residents express greater distrust in banks are more likely to fund P2P loans and, conditional on funding, lend higher amounts. This relationship is more pronounced when funding small loans or borrowers with less banking access. © The Author(s) 2020.","crowdfunding; distrust in banks; fintech; peer-to-peer lending; technology adoption","","","","","","European Commission, EC","We are grateful to Professor Bertoni, Professor Colombo and four anonymous reviewers for their constructive and insightful feedback.

Background An extensive number of studies found a significant relationship between Marketing knowledge management and bank performance (e.g., Akroush & Al-Mohammad, 2010; Hou & Chien 2010; Rezaee & Jafari, 2015; Veismoradi et al., 2013). However, there remains a lack of clarity regarding the relationship between marketing knowledge management (MKM) and bank performance (BP). Furthermore, the linkage between MKM and BP is not straightforward but, instead, includes a more complicated relationship. Therefore, it is argued that managing marketing knowledge management assets and capabilities can enhance performance via the role of financial innovation as a mediating factor on commercial banks; to date, however, there is no empirical evidence. Methodology Based on a literature review, knowledge-based theory, and financial innovation theory, an integrated conceptual framework has been developed to guide the study. A quantitative approach was used, and the data was collected from 336 managers and employees in all 13 Jordanian commercial banks using online and in hand instruments. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to analyze and verify the study variables. Contribution This article contributes to theory by filling a gap in the literature regarding the role of marketing knowledge management assets and capabilities in commercial banks operating in a developing country like Jordan. It empirically examined and validated the role of Fintech innovation as mediators between marketing knowledge management and bank performance Findings The main findings revealed that marketing knowledge management had a significant favorable influence on bank performance. Fintech innovation acted as partial mediators in this relationship. Recommendations Commercial banks should be fully aware of the importance of knowledge man-for Practitioners agement practices to enhance their financial innovation and bank performance. They should also consider promoting a culture of practicing knowledge management processes among their managers and employees by motivating and training to promote innovations. Recommendations The result endorsed Fintech innovation's mediating effect on the relationship for Researchers between the independent variable, marketing knowledge management (assets and capabilities), and the dependent variable bank performance, which was not addressed before; thus, it needs further validation. Future Research The current designed research model can be applied and assessed further in other sectors, including banking and industrial sectors across developed and developing countries. It would also be of interest to introduce other variables in the study model that can act as consequences of MKM capabilities, such as financial and non-financial performance measures. © This article is licensed to you under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License.","Bank performance; Fintech innovation; Marketing knowledge management","Commerce; Developing countries; Fintech; Human resource management; Industrial research; Knowledge based systems; Managers; Marketing; Personnel training; Conceptual frameworks; Financial innovation; Financial performance; Independent variables; Knowledge management process; Marketing knowledge; Quantitative approach; Structural equation modeling; Knowledge management","","","","","","","Abir, Mabrouk, Dynamic of financial innovation and performance of banking firms: Context of an emerging banking industry, International Research Journal of Finance and Economics, 51, pp. 17-37, (2010); Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences, (2015); International Bulletin of Business Administration, (2011); Al Balqa Journal for Research and Studies, (2006); Akroush, Mamoun N., The effect of marketing knowledge management on organizational performance: An empirical investigation of the telecommunications organizations in Jordan, International Journal of Emerging Markets, 5, 1, pp. 38-77, (2010); International Journal of Accounting and Business Society, (2018); Al-Dmour, Ahmad Hani, The impact of knowledge management practice on digital financial innovation: the role of bank managers, VINE Journal of Information and Knowledge Management Systems, 51, 3, pp. 492-514, (2020); International Review of Management and Business Research, (2015); Andreeva, Tatiana E., Knowledge processes, knowledge-intensity and innovation: A moderated mediation analysis, Journal of Knowledge Management, 15, 6, pp. 1016-1034, (2011); Business Strategy Series, (2008)","H.

The study made a novel contribution to Fintechs' data series by generating an indicator for Fintech using the principal component analysis. The findings reveal a consistent result with previous studies that both macroeconomic and bank-specific factors drive credit risk. We also found a non-linear relationship between Fintechs and credit risk. The U-shaped relationship between Fintechs and NPL revealed that BRICS economies face a dampening impact of Fintech on NPL to a certain threshold after which further adoption of Fintechs will significantly raise credit risk. The robustness checks of the dynamic panel Generalized Methods of Moments (GMM) and the fixed effect models also revealed a consistent conclusion. We recommend the optimization of the right Fintech adoption with bank collaboration among the BRICS economies. © 2020 AESS Publications.","Bank-specific factors; BRICS economies; Credit risk; Financial technology; GDP growth; Macroeconomic factors","","","","","","","","Fiscal Consolidation and Income Inequality, (2011); International Journal of Banking and Finance, (2007); Ali, Asghar, Macroeconomic determinants of credit risk: Recent evidence from a cross country study, International Review of Financial Analysis, 19, 3, pp. 165-171, (2010); Estimation of Credit Losses Based on Macroeconomic Variables and Stress Tests for the Turkish Banking Sector an Econometric Approach an Econometric Approach for Turkish Banking, (2012); Arellano, Manuel, Panel Data Econometrics, pp. 1-244, (2003); Journal of Applied Economics, (2004); Managing Global Transitions, (2008); Berger, Allen N., Problem loans and cost efficiency in commercial banks, Journal of Banking and Finance, 21, 6, pp. 849-870, (1997); Iaw Discussion Papers, (2008); Bonfim, Diana, Credit risk drivers: Evaluating the contribution of firm level information and of macroeconomic dynamics, Journal of Banking and Finance, 33, 2, pp. 281-299, (2009)","T.T.

To solve this research objective, the authors analyze fintech development trends, especially the fintech application in the banking sector in Vietnam. To improve the quality of fintech services at banks, the authors conducted consideration of factors affecting customers' intention to use fintech services. To accomplish this, the authors collected data through a survey of 620 customers of the banks located in Ho Chi Minh City-the largest economic center in Vietnam. For the analytical method, the authors used multivariate regression to estimate the research model. Research results show that fintech service is very important for the banking sector in Vietnam. Moreover, this paper has achieved great success by identifying the factors that influence customers' intention to use fintech services. Accordingly, the intention to use fintech (INT) services is positively affected by the perception of usefulness (PU), social impact (SI), customer trust (TRU), and perceived ease of use (PEU). Based on the results of this study, bank managers will have a basis to improve the quality of fintech services.

In the light of this, this paper provided functional solutions by examining developments, innovations and new financing windows available to MSMEs viz-a-viz Financial Technology that is capable of enhancing the goal of financial inclusion as a strategic tool of achieving sustainable development in the MSMEs sector in Nigeria. We classify the methodologies and approaches the researchers have adopted to predict the impact of Financial Technology on financial inclusion in respect to MSMEs financing in the South West States of Nigeria. We notice that MSMEs financing has the potential to be the fourth largest sector to be disrupted by Financial Technology in the next five years after consumer banking, payments and investment/wealth management in the financial sector. We identify that financial institutions need to collaborate and capitalize on the Financial Technology ecosystems by leveraging on artificial intelligence, big data, data analytics and MSMEs friendly applications in effectively lending to MSMEs sector. We observe that Financial Technology has the potential to drive financial inclusion, with high internet, electricity and mobile phone penetration more states will achieve the 20% financial exclusion target faster by the year 2020.

Chinese fintech companies have been successful in promoting financial inclusion and integration in their home country and are attempting to replicate this success in Southeast Asian markets. The rapid development of the Chinese fintech industry can be attributed to various factors, including a high degree of technological savvy among Chinese consumers, underdeveloped banking systems, a fintech-friendly regulatory environment, and China's improving scientific and technological prowess. Chinese technology companies are also successfully exporting their programs and technology to Southeast Asia, where many markets have a comparable base for new financial technologies. Geographic proximity as well as ethnic and cultural connections between China and Southeast Asia are also major facilitators that can help Chinese fintech companies succeed in the region. policy implications • Strict data privacy laws and regulations requiring control and scrutiny of inbound foreign investments prevent Chinese firms from engaging with Western and other advanced markets. Due to the absence of these constraints in Southeast Asian markets, China's fintech firms are emerging as major competitors. • Many Chinese fintech programs perform poorly with regard to security and privacy practices, which should be an issue of concern as they gain access to new markets. • Chinese technology firms operating in Southeast Asia could be pressured by the Chinese government to carry out censorship. For example, WeChat, used for messaging, social media, and mobile payments, has been accused of censorship activities in Southeast Asia and other foreign markets. • Western and other advanced economies such as Japan must make special efforts to bring institutional changes to Southeast Asian markets for fintech products, especially in the areas of data privacy, cybersecurity, and surveillance. There is a need for closer collaboration with like-minded governments on standards and consumer awareness of privacy and surveillance risks. If consumers understand such risks, they are more likely to prefer fintech services provided by Japanese and Western firms. © 2020 National Bureau of Asian Research.","Artificial intelligence; Blockchain; China; Financial technology; Southeast asia","","","","","","","","Payment Platform Stripe Integrates Alipay and Wechat Pay, (2017); South China Morning Post, (2017); China Daily, (2018); Kshetri, Nir, Big data's role in expanding access to financial services in China, International Journal of Information Management, 36, 3, pp. 297-308, (2016); Baidu China S Answer to Google Reports First Quarterly Loss Since 2005, (2019); Chinese Mobile Payment Market is Wechat Dominating Alipay, (2017); Shanghai Daily, (2015); Forbes, (2019); MIT Technology Review, (2019); South China Morning Post, (2017)","N.

Many of them currently rely on remittances from abroad. The number of Remittances Services Providers is constantly growing, some studies speak about the “uberisation” of the remittances market. The paper focuses on six case countries: Armenia, Georgia, Moldova, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Ukraine. It assesses the potential and current penetration of mobile money services on their remittance market. The paper finds the remittance market in the case countries to be highly competitive in terms of costs and variety of RSPs. Telco operators from the case countries have expanded their services towards certain bank-like and mobile money-like services, but the only true mobile money service so far is present in Armenia. Current portfolios of services offered by telco operators suggests that remittances inflows from Russia are important for future development of mobile money. The remittance market is thus important for mobile money development, but low costs are not the only enabling factor for these services. Other important aspects are convenience, accessibility, speed, transparency of rates, etc. Further development of mobile money in the case countries is highly probable, but it will most likely not be so intense as in other Asian and African countries. © 2020, Transition Academia Press.

The historical significance of fintech does not derive from the use of technology per se, but the leveraging of the distinct properties of digital technologies by non-traditional actors to offer consumers a better experience of financial services. More specifically, the goal of overcoming ‘friction’ in the user experience is here identified as the core feature driving many recent developments in a fintech context. This chapter explores the implications of such an account for incumbent financial institutions and regulators. From the perspective of incumbents, this new emphasis on the consumer experience requires banks and other financial institutions to organize-for-innovation. New capacities and a shift in mindset are needed to deliver a different kind of user experience, and two effective strategies for incumbents are explored. First, adopting more decentralized forms of organization and governance—what we refer to as ‘decentralized ecosystems’—that are better placed to innovate and overcome friction. Second, adopting a more strategic approach to venturing, i.e., purchasing start-ups from the fintech sector and integrating their innovations into incumbent operations. From a regulatory perspective, this requires a greater willingness on the part of regulators and other policymakers to foster experimentation in financial services. As such, the goal of regulation needs to shift from a traditional focus on managing systemic risk to more dynamic models that seek to facilitate responsible innovation and the delivery of a better-quality user experience. This can be achieved, for example, by state regulators working together—partnering—with incumbents and start-ups in the financial service ecosystems of the future via regulatory sandboxes and other similar schemes. Regulatory developments in Asia and Europe provide some evidence that policymakers recognize the need for such a shift in emphasis. However, doubts remain about whether they have gone far enough in pursuing this goal and that the full benefits of the fintech revolution have been realized. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.","Financial regulation; Fintech; Friction; Legal design; Regulatory experimentation","","","","","","","","A Brief History of the ATM, (2019); Banks Cant Partner Themselves into Digital Relevancy, (2018); Why Asia is Leading the Fintech Revolution, (2019); Open Bank Apis and Financial Services Ecosystems the Future of Banking, (2017); Harvard, (2015); Where Top US Banks are Betting on Fintech, (2019); Chishti, Susanne, The FinTech Book: The financial technology handbook for investors, entrepreneurs and visionaries, pp. 1-300, (2016); Slow Introduction of Open Banking and Apis in Japan, (2019); American Genius Nineteenth Century Banks Locks and Time, (2005); End of the Beginning, (2025)","M.

The fundamental purpose of the regulatory sandbox is to facilitate the development of fintech, especially the ‘disruptive innovation’ activities of the start-up enterprises. In this sense, the regulatory sandbox is a sub-category of the regulation of fintech. Fintech is technology-enabled financial innovation, synonymous with the term ‘internet finance’ in the Chinese context. A different but related term, the regulatory technology (regtech), in a broad sense refers to a combination of the ‘compliance technology’ by the market players with the ‘regulatory technology’ by the regulators. In nature, the regulatory sandbox is conditional, limited, and controlled deregulation. It was primarily a reaction to the somehow overly burdensome regulatory requirements after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), thus leaving a ‘lifeline’ for financial innovation and, in particular, fintech. The situation is very different in China, where the major problem for internet finance it not over-regulation but under-regulation. With a vast territory, diversified areas, and numerous institutions, China does not feature a much developed and high concentrated financial market like that of the UK, Singapore, or the HK SAR. Nor does it have an integrated financial regulatory system. And, most importantly, the existing mechanisms in China are capable of performing equivalent or even more functions than the sandbox, which, if copied in China, would be redundant. In short, the regulatory sandbox is admittedly a remarkable innovation in terms of regulatory ideas and approaches conducive to financial innovation, especially fintech. However, with its specific background, exterior conditions, and intrinsic limitations, it is by no means an inevitable choice or universal model for the regulation of fintech. Based on the actual circumstances, it’s not desirable for China to introduce the sandbox, at least for the time being. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.","Adaptive regulation; Disruptive innovation; Financial technology (fintech); Regulatory sandbox; Regulatory technology (regtech)","","","","","","","","Georgetown Journal of International Law, (2015); Arner, Douglas W., FinTech, regTech, and the reconceptualization of financial regulation, Northwestern Journal of International Law and Business, 37, 3, pp. 373-415, (2017); Sound Practices Implications of Fintech Developments for Banks and Bank Supervisors, (2017); S Afr L J, (2011); Treasury Report Endorses Fintech Bank Charters Sandboxes, (2018); Brummer, Chris J., Disruptive technology and securities regulation, Fordham Law Review, 84, 3, pp. 977-1052, (2015); Policy on no Action Letters, (2016); Fca Feedback Statement Fs 16 4 to Call for Input on Supporting the Development and Adopters of Regtech, (2016); Regulatory Sandbox Lessons Learned Report, (2017); Regulatory Sandbox","F.

A great deal of the fintech debate surrounds Grab and Go-Jek, two ridesharing platforms that are aggressively expanding their business geographically and product-wise. To finance the expansion, these firms rely on various investors. These investors do often not limit their interest in these two firms but also become shareholders in firms offering the same products. This form of shareholding, also known as horizontal shareholding, is increasingly characterizing the fintech scene in Asia. This triggers the question on how this phenomenon should be approached from a competition law perspective. Horizontal shareholding indeed facilitates the flow of information between competitors or enables control over the executives of competing firms. The issue is still controversial as there is disagreement on the effects of horizontal shareholding and on how competition law should be applied to the issue. However, there is an understanding that further research is warranted. Part of this research, this chapter argues, should not be on direct price increase due to horizontal shareholding. The international character of the horizontal shareholding in the Asian fintech sector requires a rethinking of the possible anticompetitive effects. This chapter claims that such an effect may be market division. Enforcement may be a difficult issue. However, when a merger occurs in this sector, enforcement authorities should pay close attention to the issue of horizontal shareholding. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.","Asia; Competition law; Fintech; Go-Jek; Grab; Horizontal shareholding; Market division; Price increase","","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (18K01300)","","Common Ownership Competition and Top Management Incentives, (2018); Common Ownership Trilemma, (2019); A New Look at Oligopoly Implicit Collusion Through Portfolio Diversification, (2012); Azar, José A., Anticompetitive Effects of Common Ownership, Journal of Finance, 73, 4, pp. 1513-1565, (2018); Go Jek Buys 3 Fintech Firms to Conquer Indonesia Payments, (2017); Global Fintech Investment Rockets to A Record 111 8b in 2018 Driven by Mega Deals Kpmg Pulse of Fintech, (2019); Bostoen, Friso, Blog highlight: The uber-grab merger and the potentially anti-competitive consequences of the battle for ride-hailing dominance, European Competition and Regulatory Law Review, 4, 1, pp. 64-68, (2020); Bresnahan, Timothy F., Quantifying the competitive effects of production joint ventures, International Journal of Industrial Organization, 4, 2, pp. 155-175, (1986); Journal of Financial Transformation, (2016); A Competition Law Analysis of Common Shareholdings, (2018)","S.

The fintech business model in Japan is similar as in other countries: crowdfunding, cryptocurrency, blockchain, AI, Big Data, and cashless payments. What has been the largest impact of fintech in Japan? At first glance, fintech seems to require a change in the financial regulation framework, but this is not the case. In Japan, traditional financial regulation is piecemeal or trident, with a separate legislative framework for banking, insurance, and securities. This framework is not unreasonable because it is designed to respond to different risks. Of course, some other new financial businesses appeared before fintech, and regulation responded to the new risk. Fintech is not a completely new business but just the unbundling of current financial businesses. Especially, payment became more independent from banking today, thanks to the fintech movement. Therefore, regulation just for payment is required more clearly. Currently, the FSA is planning to create a new category of regulation for it. It seems fintech requires a change in the basic framework of financial law. But both in practice and in theory, a pure payment service has attracted attention before fintech. Therefore, fintech, or any other technological innovation, does not require a complete change of regulation but a clarification of current law. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.","Banking; Financial regulation; Fintech; Japan; Payment","","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (JP18H00808, JP18H03611, JP19K01362)","Acknowledgements This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Numbers JP19K01362, JP18H00808, JP18H03611.","Kinyuhomujijo, (2018); University of Chicago Legal Forum, (1996); Prudential Regulation of Banks, (1994); A Program for Monetary Stability, (1960); Journal of Political Economy, (1986); Growth Strategy 2017 Initiatives and Program; Firms Contracts and Financial Structure, (1995); Initial Coin Offering He no Taiou Ni Tsuite about Response to the Initial Coin Offering, (2017); Duke L J, (1992); Kinnyuseido Study Group Chukan Seirikinoubetsu Oudanteki Na Kinyu Taikei Ni Mukete Intermediate Summary of Study Group of Financial System Towards the Functional and Cross Sectional Framework of Financial Regulation, (2018)","A.

In the banking sector, the main focus is on the development of internet-only banking. Under the strict regulations on the separation of financial capital and industrial capital, technological companies’ entry into the banking business causes serious banking law debates. In capital markets, the application of the fintech model in capital markets such as equity and debt-based crowdfunding and robo-advisors is widely discussed. Easy payment & remittance and crypto-assets are a concern for both legal practitioners and the business sector. The legal character and function of crypto-assets is also a significant issue in Korea. In Korea, institutional efforts to introduce new financial products and services in accordance with the combination of technology and finance are being developed in various fields such as banking and securities. Particularly noteworthy is the introduction of new means of payment.

Such legal reforms are motivated by the desire to encourage the development of fintech, while also ensuring that vital public interests are adequately protected. This book is a preliminary attempt to map some of these legal developments in an Asian context via a series of case studies focused on key jurisdictions.

Fintech offers automation opportunities for financial institutions, and such automation will in most cases make banks more competitive and lower their labor needs. The Hong Kong government has actively embraced fintech to ensure competitiveness, and its regulation tracks leading international positions on ICOs, cryptocurrency and electronic payment. However, Hong Kong regulators have not facilitated fintech activities that would stimulate the local economy, such as equity crowdfunding. Automation will generally translate into a reduction of human labor, particularly in mid-level jobs. In a large and varied economy, persons laid off from jobs at banks can seek engagement elsewhere. This is not necessarily true in an IFC with a less diversified economy. Hong Kong presents the highly unusual case of persons in a small IFC who have access to a large and diverse economy in mainland China yet may refuse to seek new positions in the larger workplace for cultural or political reasons. The Hong Kong government has blithely followed a ‘market leads, government facilitates’ philosophy of laissez-faire for decades and thus also has failed to prepare for the social costs of fintech. While such preparation would indeed constitute social planning, an activity generally discouraged in Hong Kong, circumstances dictate that the HKSAR government begin to act socially, rather than merely facilitate the largest businesses. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.","Automation; Financial regulation; Fintech; Hong Kong","","","","","","","","Hong Kong Protests Rule of Law on Brink of Collapse Police Say, (2019); Hsbc Says Its Made the Worlds First Trade Finance Transaction Using Blockchain, (2018); Blankfein Says Its Too Soon for A Bitcoin Strategy, (2017); Keynote Speech at Treasury Markets Summit 2018 Cryptoassets and Money, (2018); Insight, (2018); Bitcoin Tumbles as Pboc Declares Initial Coin Offerings Illegal, (2017); Beyond the Umbrella Movement Hong Kongs Struggle with Inequality in 8 Charts, (2014); A Marriage of Robotic Process Automation and Machine Learning, (2019); Mckinsey Q, (2019); A Financial Centre for Two Empires, (2014)","D.C.

Adopting systematic and historical methods of research, the dialectic of two typological structures of financial ties is considered. The interaction of distributed network structures with equal subjects of economic activity and hierarchical institutional structures with state participation is explored. It is revealed that with the development of innovations and financial technologies, the use of distributed network channels is increasing. The conclusion is made that there are potentially two strategic approaches for the development of banks: Evolutionary and revolutionary, involving in the first case the transformation of their classical business model into a technology company, and in the second, full absorption by alternative distributed services, based on block technologies and consumer power. © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd..

As the evolution of FinTech has laid the foundation for the next generation of technical innovation in the financial service sectors, this chapter discusses examples of FinTech innovation and analyzes their opportunities as well as their ecological, societal, and technological risks from consumer and retail investor perspectives. While FinTech innovation has the potential to make financial services easier, cheaper, and better available, all payment and investment services discussed in this chapter have in common the technological risks arising from the possibility to (mis)use consumers’ and retail investors’ data for price discrimination or identity theft. Cryptocurrencies additionally pose ecological risks due to their enormous energy demand, while the new investment services may help retail investors to decrease the ecological risk of their portfolios. The societal risks of FinTech overlap or coincide with the technological risks, for example, when consumer data is used to discriminate groups of consumers. In addition, the high degree of anonymity in cryptocurrency networks and the lack of centralized supervision can provide an ideal playing field for criminal activities such as money laundering and tax evasion that threaten consumer and retail investor welfare. © 2020, The Author(s).","","","","","","","","","Ali, Syed Taha, Bitcoin: Perils of an unregulated global P2P currency, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 9379, pp. 283-293, (2015); Evolution of Fintech A New Post Crisis Paradigm, (2015); undefined; Crowdinvesting, (2017); Robo Advice Und Auto Trading Plattformen Zur Automatisi Erten Anlageberatung Und Automatischem Trading, (2017); Ben-David, Itzhak, Do ETFs Increase Volatility?, Journal of Finance, 73, 6, pp. 2471-2535, (2018); Handbuch Des Finanzmanagements Instrumente Und Markte Der Unternehmensfinanzierung, (1993); Böhme, Rainer, Bitcoin: Economics, technology, and governance, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 29, 2, pp. 213-238, (2015); Brühl, Volker, Bitcoins, Blockchain, and Distributed Ledgers, Wirtschaftsdienst, 97, 2, pp. 135-142, (2017); Chaum, David L., BLIND SIGNATURES FOR UNTRACEABLE PAYMENTS., Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pp. 199-203, (1983)","M.

This article will briefly introduce Fintech as well as its development in Vietnam. Besides, the research also provided a survey on experts' opinions on the challenges to the promotion of Fintech application for the modernization of the banking-finance system in Vietnam. The survey results of 40 experts in banking with knowledge of Fintech identify five challenges faced by Fintech companies in Vietnam: (1) legal corridor; (2) infrastructure; (3) Fintech companies; (4) customers; and (5) human resources. From these five challenges/barriers, there are 14 detailed aspects. The results of the expert survey using descriptive statistics show that all five factors are assessed to be low and need to be better addressed in the future. The authors suggest several solutions for further development of Fintech to support the modernization of the banking-finance system in Vietnam: (1) quickly complete the regulatory framework; (2) introduce policies on tax exemption; (3) promote research and application of the benefits of block-chain technology; (4) utilize the abilities of the human resources; and (5) actively promote and popularize knowledge about Fintech. © 2020 The Author(s).","Banking-Finance system; Fintech; Fintech application; Vietnam","","","","","","","","Accenture Study Finds, (2016); Fintech and the Evolving Landscape Landing Points for the Industry, (2016); Innovation in Payments the Future is Fintech, (2015); undefined, (2017); Future of Finance, (2025); 2016 Top Markets Report Financial Technology; H2 Ventures Kpmg Fintech 100 Announcing the World S Leading Fintech Innovators for 2015, (2015); Lee, In, Fintech: Ecosystem, business models, investment decisions, and challenges, Business Horizons, 61, 1, pp. 35-46, (2018); Li, Pengtao, Current and Future Years of E-Commerce, pp. 1031-1044, (2016); Mollick, Ethan, The dynamics of crowdfunding: An exploratory study, Journal of Business Venturing, 29, 1, pp. 1-16, (2014)","D.

Consequently, most adults around the world are classified as financial illiterate (FI). Billions of individuals belonging to low-income populations (LIPs) do not have the means to plan for retirement. Regardless, they are often measured through the same FL Measurements (FLMs) and classified as FIs. LIPs are not necessarily incapable of making financial decisions, but FLMs do not necessarily fit their context, making it an inappropriate measurement. Moreover, FinTech is increasing the financial options that LIPs have. It is thus relevant to create an appropriate measurement that addresses this inadequacy. This paper is a first step towards the creation of a measurement called “Financial Awareness” that is geared towards LIPs who access financial services (FS) through Information Communication Technologies (ICTs). © Proceedings of the 24th Pacific Asia Conference on Information Systems: Information Systems (IS) for the Future, PACIS 2020.

The proposed approach brings together the user’s behavior with his/her cognitive and emotional states to produce a rich overview of his/her experience. Combining these methods produces key insights into the user experience and facilitates an understanding of the evolution of the experience since it highlights where the user was on the interface when s/he experienced a given cognitive and emotional state.

Further, financial inclusion is closely related to fintech. On the one hand, fintech helps overcome the financial inclusion problem because fintech manages to reach those who were previ-ously inaccessible by banks. On the other hand, fintech will change the payment system structure in an economy that will eventually affect the effectiveness of monetary policy. Using the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) with the observa-tion period of 2009–2018, this study aims to analyze the effects of financial inclusion and fintech on effectiveness of the Indonesian monetary policy within the framework of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy through interest rate channel with both the cost of capital effect and the substitution effect. The results demonstrate that financial inclusion level affects inflation rate as a proxy of effectiveness of the Indonesian monetary policy, both in the short run and long run. However, the effect of shocks in financial inclusion on inflation is not permanent. Meanwhile, fintech only affects inflation rate in the short run. However, shocks in fintech affect the volatility of inflation rate is permanent both through the substitution effect and the cost of capital effect. © 2020 The Author(s).

It is argued that disparities in record keeping regulation across communication mediums disincentivizes the use of technology capable of generating records for consumer retention, while incentivizing the use of technology which shields financial advisors from accountability. Experimental evidence is provided in support of this argument. Further, it is argued that regulation disparities across communication mediums may result in more wrongful accusations of advisor misconduct, less reporting of genuine misconduct, less self-policing among industry members, and greater unrectifiable consumer harm. Objections to these arguments are considered, along with practical guidance for consumers, regulators, and policy makers. © Copyright 2020 Association for Financial Counseling and Planning Education, U.S.A.","communication; consumer protection; financial advice; planner–client relationship; record keeping; regulation","","","","","","","","Campbell, John Y., Restoring rational choice: The challenge of consumer financial regulation, American Economic Review, 106, 5, pp. 1-30, (2016); Cao, Yingxia, Antecedents and Consequences of Using Social Media for Personal Finance, Journal of Financial Counseling and Planning, 31, 1, pp. 162-176, (2020); U S Advisor Metrics 2017 the Next Generation of Planning Report, (2017); Journal of Financial Education, (2017); Journal of Financial Planning, (2017); Christiansen, Tim, Antecedents of trust and commitment in the financial planner-client relationship, Journal of Financial Counseling and Planning, 9, 2, pp. 1-10, (1998); Collins, J.

The purpose of this research is to analyze how the dispute raised from the situations faced by people who involved in fintech peer to peer lending can be solved in fairness. The methodology used in this research are statute approach, conceptual approach, and comparison dispute settlement among Australia and Indonesia through law case study. According to the Indonesian Law as it is stated in BW (Civil Code for Indonesia), companies can settle their loan disputes by filing a lawsuit to the district court. This method is less effective because it is time consuming and costly, while it is not worth with the nominal value of the loan which is not that much. This situation leads to a demand of a faster, simpler and low-cost solution that can be accessed online. This method is called as small claim court method. This method is considerably new and basically is a simplified procedure of the existing dispute settlement. A strong note on this method is its weakness when the disputes happen cross-border. This aspect needs to be improved in many ways considering the current method is only applicable when the parties have the same judicial territory. Hopefully, the information technology strongly supports the task of the judiciary in order to enforce law and legal justice through the application of Electronic Court (e-court) which is in line with the principle of simple, fast and low cost of justice. Vice versa, fintech lending dispute resolution requires procedural law that can compensate for the technology that is developing rapidly. The information technology management referred to information management policies, institutional information management institutional arrangements, and electronic system structuring at the Supreme Court. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.","Dispute settlement; E-court; Lending; Online dispute resolution; Small claim court; Supply chain financial technology","","","","","","","","undefined; undefined; Taubayev, Zharas, Peculiarities and problems of eponyms (On the material of Kazakhstani periodicals), Opcion, 34, 85-2, pp. 221-236, (2018); Cepat Dan Berbiaya Ringan Mimbar Hukum, (2013); Alternative Law Journal, (1995); Singapore Journal of Legal Studies, (1996); Tracy, Karen, Decision announcements in small claims court: A recurring judge dilemma, Language and Dialogue, 9, 1, pp. 65-83, (2019); Alternative Dispute Resolution Tania Sourdin Thomson Reuters Professional Australia Ltd, (2016); International Journal of Online Dispute Resolution, (2019); Selintas Pintas Hukum Perikatan Bagian Umum, (2017)","","","ExcelingTech excelingtech@gmail.com","","","","","","20513771","","","","English","Int.

Here, we revisit the question of how banks and regulators can best respond to this disruption. We argue that incumbent financial service providers can learn useful lessons from the experience of the most innovative companies in the world and their efforts to navigate the new realities of doing business in a networked age. One of the striking features of successful large businesses with an established track record for sustained high performance has been their capacity to reinvent themselves as what we characterise as innovation ‘ecosystems’. A key element of an ‘ecosystem’style organisation has been the implementation of effective corporate venturing strategies that feed dynamic, technology-driven innovation (what has been termed borrowing “the Start-Up Genie’s Magic”). Here, we identify seven corporate venturing strategies adopted by the most innovative companies in the world and argue that incumbent banks and other financial service providers could utilise similar strategies in responding to FinTech. A crucial element of these strategies is a recognition of the value of co-creation, namely an inclusive, collaborative partnering between incumbents and non-traditional market players. To implement this objective effectively, incumbents need to absorb the energy, skills, and resources of the most dynamic start-ups. We argue that some banks are already moving in this direction and that this trend towards the ‘unbundling’ of incumbents is likely to continue. We conclude with a brief discussion of the implications of such an account for regulators and regulatory design, more generally. In order to establish an environment for successful and sustainable ‘ecosystems’, regulators need to become active participants in these more open forms of business organisation. We characterise this regulatory approach as ‘community-driven’ regulatory design and identify some key issues with such a regulatory strategy. © 2020, National University of Singapore, Faculty of Law.

The paper used a qualitative analysis of the development of fintech in the banking system of Russia. The active participation of the state was revealed (including the Bank of Russia), the creation of associations and joint business projects, the growth in fintech financing, primarily by large Russian banks, the transition of large Russian banks to the use of new business models and the production of new banking services, increased sales personalization banking services, reducing risks in banking and increasing its productivity, reducing both banks and their branches. The use of the multiple regression apparatus made it possible to identify an inversely proportional dependence of the number of internal structural units of Russian credit organizations on the volume of payment orders received via the Internet and using subscriber mobile communication devices. The multiple regression equation allows us to predict the dynamics of structural units of Russian credit organizations. It is concluded that with the development of fintech, the number of structural divisions and the number of traditional jobs of bank employees are sharply reduced.

The focus has now shifted from spread of the disease to the economic consequences it will bring to the society. The shortage of production will result into the shortage of supply and consequently will end as loss of jobs and employment for millions of people around the world. Two of the most important section of our society i.e., daily wage laborers and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) will have to bear the major burnt of this crisis. The proposed integrated Artificial Intelligence and NLP based Islamic FinTech Model combining Zakat (Islamic tax) and Qardh-Al-Hasan (benevolent loan) can help the economy to minimize the adverse impact of COVID 19 on individuals and SMEs. Design/Methodology/Approach: The present study explores the possibility of Zakat and Qardh-Al-Hasan as a financing method to fight the adverse impact of Corona virus on poor individuls and SMEs. It provides the solution by proposing an Artificial Intelligence and NLP based Islamic FinTech Model combining Zakat and Qardh-Al-Hasan. Findings: The findings of the study reveals that Islamic finance has immense potential to fight any kind of situation/pandemic. Zakat and Qardh-Al-Hasan, if combined together can prove to be a deadly combination to fight the adverse effect of COVID 19. Practical Implications: To be used as an effective way to support individuals and SMEs in the period during and after the pandemic of COVID 19. Originality/value: There is no study combining Zakat and Qardh Al-Hasan to fight the adverse effect of poor individuals and SMEs. The study will contribute massively to the existing literature and will help the government and civil societies in fighting the economic impact of COVID 19 on individuals and SMEs. © 2020 International Strategic Management Association.

The implemented state policy of informatization of all spheres of public life dictates the need not only for resource support of informatization events, but also requires restructuring of traditional financial mechanisms of maintenance of these processes. Today’s changes are impossible without a clear and efficient financing vehicle, fully adapted to the needs of digital economy and taking account of all possible complexities of remote account management. New financial instruments should be not only efficient, but also well protected from unauthorized use aimed at stealing funds from customer and state accounts. Methodology: in the process of the research, the principles of systematization and logical analysis of the text, the methods of graphic and tabular data analysis, horizontal and vertical analysis, the methods of generalizing and generating ideas have been used for the processing and assessment of statistical material. Results: In accordance with special features of a new model of ecosystem of the digital transformation of society, we need to search for new solutions both in the area of financing and in the area of finance services of occurring changes. Existing financial mechanisms do not have enough potential and capabilities for the prompt response to the needs of the financial market. All of the above gives rise to the emergence of new forms of provision of services to the customers—digital, online banks, the number and scale of which are constantly growing. Recommendations: The primary areas of digitalization of the financial sector that were discussed in this paper will promote accelerated transition of society to the communication platform. The development of existing and the introduction of new information tools for the provision of financial services online allows expanding capabilities of the financial sector for the provision of services for business in a digital environment. However, in order to achieve efficient use of new financial instruments, one should primarily create a new financial infrastructure that would allow keeping digital platforms operational and maintaining digital interaction. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Budget allocations; Digital economy; Digital financial instruments; Information society","","","","","","","","Bulletin of South Western State University Series Economics Social Sciences Management, (2017); Fedotova, Gilyan Vasylievna, Transformation of information security systems of enterprises in the context of digitization of the national economy, Studies in Computational Intelligence, 826, pp. 811-822, (2019); 2nd International Research to Practice Conference October 12 2015, (2015); Plotnikov, V.

In the Russian Federation, this process is in its formative stage. The object of the research was public relations in the sphere of creation and use of financial technologies. The subject of the study was the normative material of a number of technologically developed foreign countries in order to identify positive experiences that can be implemented in the domestic practice of creation legal regulation and use of financial technologies. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the dialectical method of cognition of the surrounding reality, the research is based on a comparative analysis of the national peculiarities of the implementation of policies to regulate the basic social relations associated with the creation and use of financial technologies. Findings: It is noted that realizing the need to create a mechanism of legal regulation of new financial technologies the states have not fully developed a unified policy in addressing this issue.

Similarly, the sharia financial technology industry also grows rapidly due to Muslim adoption of information technology for financial transaction. However, limited studies have been conducted to understand the factors that influence Muslim consumers to adopt sharia FinTech products. Through the use of the variables of halal product expectation, social environment, and fiqih knowledge, we surveyed eighty Muslim sharia FinTech consumers to understand whether those three variables affect their intention to use sharia FinTech products such as online loans. The results show that halal product expectation and fiqih knowledge factors have significantly affect Muslim consumers in Indonesia to use sharia FinTech products. Meanwhile, social environment, such as friends or higher Muslim figures, does not influence Muslim consumers to use the sharia FinTech products. We conclude that sharia FinTech companies should focus on improving their products to comply with Islamic sharia principles rather than using social environment to attract Muslim consumers to purchase their products. Future research may require more variable in similar studies to increase validity and reliability. © 2020, Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Fiqih knowledge; Sharia financial technology; Sharia FinTech product expectation; Social environment","","","","","","","","International Journal of Social Science Studies, (2016); Al-Hajla, Ali Homaid, Understanding New Religion-Compliant Product Adoption (NRCPA) in Islamic Markets, Journal of Global Marketing, 32, 4, pp. 288-302, (2019); Ada 150 Juta Pengguna Internet Ojk Dorong Peran Fintech, (2019); Mengenal Fintech Syariah Apa Perbedaannya Dengan Konvensional, (2018); Paper Presented at the International Conference on Economics, (2019); International Journal of Exercise Science, (2015); Mau Ajukan Dana Pinjaman Pastikan Dulu Penyedianya Ada Di Daftar Ojk Berikut Ini, (2019); Briliana, Vita, Exploring antecedents and consequences of Indonesian Muslim youths’ attitude towards halal cosmetic products: A case study in Jakarta, Asia Pacific Management Review, 22, 4, pp. 176-184, (2017); Bukhari, Syed Faheem Hasan, Is religiosity an important consideration in Muslim consumer behavior: Exploratory study in the context of western imported food in Pakistan, Journal of Islamic Marketing, 10, 4, pp. 1288-1307, (2019); Chen, Zhuming, The transition from traditional banking to mobile internet finance: an organizational innovation perspective - a comparative study of Citibank and ICBC, Financial Innovation, 3, 1, (2017)","","","Primrose Hall Publishing Group","","","","","","22011315","","","","English","Int.

It covers a large range of technologies, including big data, cloud computing, and cryptocurrency, and is widely used in the finance industry. Despite the broad application of FinTech, little academic research has explored the development of this new wave of technological innovations. Our study aims to identify, classify, and track the development of FinTech innovations using patent data. A difficulty is that there are no accurate International Patent Classification (IPC) codes that we can refer to as FinTech innovations. Hence, in this paper we provide a comprehensive method for identifying FinTech patents. We first use a text-based filtering technique to locate potential FinTech patents and get a data set comprising 37,156 records. We then construct a training sample of FinTech patents by reading those patent files manually. Next, textual analysis and machine-learning techniques are applied to identify all FinTech patents in the whole data set, based on the initial sample. We classify FinTech patents into seven categories according to the key underlying technologies and track the development of each category.

The Islamic FinTech area has been classified into three broad categories of the Islamic FinTech, Islamic Financial technology opportunities and challenges, Cryptocurrency/Blockchain sharia compliance and law/regulation. Finally, the study identifies and highlights the opportunities and challenges that Islamic Financial institutions can learn from the conventional FinTech organization across the world. Approach/Methodology/Design: The study collected 133 research studies (50 from Social Science Research Network (SSRN), 30 from Research gate, 33 from Google Scholar and 20 from other sources) in the area of Islamic Financial Technology. The study presents the systematic review of the above studies. Findings: The study classifies the Islamic FinTech into three broad categories namely, Islamic FinTech opportunities and challenges, Cryptocurrency/Blockchain sharia compliance and law/regulation. The study identifies that the sharia compliance related to the cryptocurrency/Blockchain is the biggest challenge which Islamic FinTech organizations are facing. During our review we also find that Islamic FinTech organizations are to be considered as partners by the Islamic Financial Institutions (IFI's) than the competitors. If Islamic Financial institutions want to increase efficiency, transparency and customer satisfaction they have to adopt FinTech and become partners with the FinTech companies. Practical Implications: The study will contribute positively to the understanding of Islamic Fintech for the academia, industry, regulators, investors and other FinTech users. Originality/Value: The study believes to contribute positively to understanding of Fintech based technology like cryptocurrency/Blockchain from sharia perspective. © 2020 International Strategic Management Association.

Design/Methodology/Approach: In this paper we evolve possible approaches of FinTech legal definition, investigate existing approaches at the international level and examine the policies applied at the national levels. Document analysis, as a form of qualitative research, was used in this study. Findings: We found that in most countries the legislation does not specifically address fintech companies, and the legal framework equally regulates the activities of traditional service providers and fintech operators. In our opinion, no specific legislation for FinTech companies needed, each type of activity provided by a financial or technology company is subject to a specific legislation/regulation with primary focus on services and products provided as payments, insurance, investments etc. Practical Implications: The term FinTech is freely used by policy makers, regulators, companies, researchers, academics and the public, both nationally and internationally. According to international organizations such as the IMF, the World Bank and the OECD, FinTech offers the opportunity to accelerate economic growth and expand financial affordability/inclusion in all countries. Some countries are increasingly striving to become global or international regional hubs for FinTech and are working hard to develop interagency government strategies with a supportive legal environment. Originality/Value: There is still confusion about the nature and dynamics of FinTech among politicians, scientists and practitioners, as well as about the legal framework of this area. The value of this article is to clarify and propose an apprach to definition of FinTech by combining different approaches in a very original and innovative way. © 2020 International Strategic Management Association.

It is because of the high financing needs of the people who have not been reached by the banks. The existence of lending fintech is getting stronger with the issuance of the Financial Service Authority Regulation Number 77 of 2018 concerning Information Technology-Based Money Lending and Borrowing Services. Until August 2019, there were 127 lending fintech registered in the Financial Service Authority. Unfortunately, there is still a problem concerning protecting consumers who make loan transactions with fintech companies, along with the rise of illegal fintech companies. Therefore, this paper tries to analyze the potential development of lending fintech in Indonesia, along with its opportunities and challenges. The study of this research uses normative juridical. This paper concludes that the current regulation is still not enough in providing legal protection to consumers in conducting the transaction in lending fintech. Therefore, it is necessary to make a comprehensive regulation that regulates this so that public trust in the lending fintech company is higher. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Fintech; Current regulations; Financial service authorities; Indonesia; Legal protection; Public trust; Consumer protection","","","","","","","Daftar Perusahaan Fintech, (2019); Siaran Pers no SP 06 Ix Swi 2019 Satgas Temukan 123 Fintech Ilegal 30 Gadai Swasta Dan 49 Entitas Penawaran Investasi Tanpa Izin, (2019); Ylki Layanan Jasa Keuangan Catat Aduan Konsumen Terbanyak Di 2018 Artikel Ini Telah Tayang Di Katadata Co Id Dengan Judul Ylki Layanan Jasa Keuangan Catat Aduan Konsumen Terbanyak Di 2018, (2019); Terjerat Pinjaman Online 1330 Korban Mengadu Ke Lbh Jakarta, (2018); Regulasi Tidak Melindungi Masyarakat Pinjaman Online Pertaruhkan Nyawa, (2019); Indonesia S Fintech Lending Driving Economic Growth Through Financial Inclusion, (2019); Fintech Opportunity, (2016); Schueffel, Patrick, Taming the beast: A scientific definition of fintech, Journal of Innovation Management, 4, 4, pp. 32-54, (2016); Anugerah, Dian Purnama, Data Protection in Financial Technology Services: Indonesian Legal Perspective, IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science, 175, 1, (2018); Bul Huk Kebanksentralan, (2017)","","Vaidyanathan, S.; Mamat, M.B.; Lien, C.-H.; Ginta, T.L.; Mujiarto; Sambas, A.","Institute of Physics Publishing helen.craven@iop.org","","2nd International Conference on Computer, Science, Engineering, and Technology, ICComSET 2019","2019-10-15 through 2019-10-16","Tangerang, Banten","159200","17426588","9788394593742; 9781628905861","","","English","J.

Therefore, we conducted an in-depth interview with 15scholars and Fintech specialists from different Gulf universities (i.e. from Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait, and Oman). In addition, the study used secondary data to explore the current opportunities and education of universities in the field of Fintech; and the projects and researches in this field, which emerged with new technological developments in universities. Websites on the financial departments of universities in the GCC, data from the national education Ministry of the concerned countries were also examined.The findings reveal thatnone of the universities in the GCC is included in the top 10 leaders in Fintech/crypto education. Despite there are a sufficientnumber of finance departments and centers of research, most universities in the GCC have inappropriate education systems for preparing professional staff working in the Fintech sector. Furthermore, the training process is also not making the necessary progress for this industry to join the international race in this field. Approaches of education are still traditional and behind the advancement of others, there is classic methods of learning and education techniques with no real connection with technology. We conclude that each educated individual in the GCC has to think about Fintech in light of the fact that it may be one of the world's most significant advancements in the near future. Further, the blockchain technology may assist us with changing the connections among schools, colleges, universities and, thusly, their relationship to society. © 2019 SERSC.","Blockchain; Finance; Financial Technology; Fintech Education; GCC; Higher Education","","","","","","","","Social Science Learning Education Journal, (2018); Abdeldayem, Marwan Mohamed, Cryptocurrency in the gcc economy, International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research, 9, 2, pp. 1739-1758, (2020); Abdeldayem, Marwan Mohamed, Trends and opportunities of artificial intelligence in human resource management: Aspirations for public sector in Bahrain, International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research, 9, 1, pp. 3867-3871, (2020); Abdeldayem, Marwan Mohamed, Lessons drawn from privatisation in developing countries: Evidence from an emerging economy, International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research, 9, 3, pp. 6159-6171, (2020); Journal of Xian University of Architecture Technology, (2020); International Journal of Learning and Development, (2018); International Business Management, (2018); Hameed Aldulaimi, Saeed Hameed Kurdi, How changes in leadership behaviour and management influence sustainable higher education in Bahrain, International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research, 8, 11, pp. 1926-1934, (2019); Bitcoin Q A Energy Consumption Bitcoin Open Blockchain Community Event, (2017); Arner, Douglas W., FinTech, regTech, and the reconceptualization of financial regulation, Northwestern Journal of International Law and Business, 37, 3, pp. 373-415, (2017)","M.M.

The informants of this research were from the Financial Services Authority (OJK) as the agency that supervises Fintech's performance. This research used empirical juridical legal approach by examining the regulations and then proceeding with interviews. The analysis technique used was the descriptive method to explain various symptoms and facts in everyday life. Normative data from this study were from laws, journals, several regulations, and other materials, while empirical data was obtained from interviews with OJK. The results showed that the mechanism of the Regulatory Sandbox was run in accordance with the Regulations of the Governor Board Members Number 19/14/PADG/2017, concerning the limited testing room (Regulatory Sandbox) of Financial technology and POJK RI Number 13/POJK.02/2018, regarding Digital Financial Innovation in the Financial Services Sector.

In the existing research, however, there are disagreements and gaps relating to the efficiency measurement of the financial system's input and output, as well as the impact of financial efficiency on the credit constraints facing the industrial sector. Based on China's provincial panel data from 2008 to 2016, this paper measures and decomposes financial technology efficiency, and selects system equations to comprehensively test the internal and external transmission mechanism of financial technology efficiency. The research finds that: (1) The key to improving the efficiency of input and output of China's financial system lies in the effective absorption and utilization of financial system reform and financial technology innovation, that is, the utilization efficiency of financial frontier technology; (2) The key to improving the utilization efficiency of financial frontier technology lies in the overall reform of the economic system, including the development of the private economy, the expansion of market opening, the acceleration of service industry development, and the promotion of technological innovation. (3) The improvement of financial technology efficiency is the key to reducing costs, de-leveraging and increasing efficiency in the industrial sector. It can effectively alleviate the credit constraints facing the industrial sector and promote its high-quality development. Therefore, it is necessary to promote the reform and opening up of the economic system with a view to promoting the efficiency of the financial system, rather than simply resorting to financial system reform and financial technology innovation. © 2020 IEEE.","Credit constraint; Financial frontier technology; Stochastic frontier; System equations; Technology efficiency","Efficiency; Engineering research; Facings; Fintech; Industrial research; Service industry; Stochastic systems; Credit constraints; Efficiency measurement; Stochastic frontier; System equations; Technological innovation; Technology efficiency; Transmission mechanisms; Utilization efficiency; Industrial economics","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71602002, 71972002); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Youth Foundation of China under Grant 71602002 and National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 71972002.","Gulen, Huseyin, Policy uncertainty and corporate investment, Review of Financial Studies, 29, 3, pp. 523-564, (2016); Economic Research Journal, (2016); China Industrial Economics, (2017); Journal of Financial Research, (2011); Journal of World Economy, (2012); China Economic Quarterly, (2016); Lien, Gudbrand, Determinants of off-farm work and its effects on farm performance: The case of Norwegian grain farmers, Agricultural Economics (United Kingdom), 41, 6, pp. 577-586, (2010); Badunenko, Oleg, Economies of scale, technical change and persistent and time-varying cost efficiency in Indian banking: Do ownership, regulation and heterogeneity matter?, European Journal of Operational Research, 260, 2, pp. 789-803, (2017); Management World, (2013); Econ Sci, (2018)","Y.

The study drew from the fact that there is significant latent demand for digital payments in many markets of sub-Saharan Africa, and widespread consumer acceptance of mobile-communications technology is highly encouraging. The study sought to examine the effect of technology, among other things, on money demand. Design/Methodology/Approach: The study used panel data and a GMM panel technique to analyse the study's findings. Findings: Results showed that all variables that captured financial technology have a negative effect with money demand (MD). Both Mobile Subscriptions (MS) and ATM (Automated Teller Machines) have a negative relationship with money demand (MD). Practical implications: Based on the results obtained in this study, the study recommended that Central Banks need to monitor and predict the consequences of financial innovations. As African states proceed with reforms of its financial sector, the stability of the demand for money would have to be reexamined and instruments of the Central Bank modified to ensure an effective control of money demand. Originality/Value: A little has been done on the effect of technological developments on money demand in Africa. An understanding of the way technological developments may positively or negatively impact on money demand may guide Central banks in adopting and implementing appropriate monetary policies and actions. © 2020 International Strategic Management Association.

Indian Government has been trying hard to provide financial services to the people who don't have access to these services through 'Digital Drive-, which was partially successful. But still large number of rural people especially farmers depends on traditional credit system. Presently to support farmer technologically Agri- tech is providing services. Fin-tech provides financial service to all the sectors, but there is no impact on farming sector for providing credit facilities. So the farmers are more dependent on the private lenders for loans with high interest rates for their farming needs. But due to this repayment of loan with high interest has become huge burden and is leading to suicides and deaths. The aim of the paper is to analyze the fin- tech in Agri sector and its impact in helping the farmers to fulfill their needs to lesser their burdens.

This is essential to establish a “Social Licence” for current and future practices. The notion of a “Social Licence” recognises that there can be meaningful differences between what is legally permissible and what is socially acceptable. Establishing a Social Licence entails public engagement to build relationships of trust and ensure that practices align with public values. While the concept of the Social Licence is well-established in other sectors – notably in relation to extractive industries – it has only very recently begun to be discussed in relation to digital innovation and data-intensive industries. This article therefore draws on existing literature relating to the Social Licence in extractive industries to explore the potential approaches needed to establish a Social Licence for emerging data-intensive industries. Additionally, it draws on well-established literature relating to trust (from psychology and organisational science) to examine the relevance of trust, and trustworthiness, for emerging practices in data-intensive industries. In doing so the article considers the extent to which pursuing a Social Licence might complement regulation and inform codes of practice to place ethical and social considerations at the heart of industry practice. We focus on one key industry: Financial Technology. We demonstrate the importance of combining technical and social approaches to address ethical challenges in data-intensive innovation (particularly relating to Artificial Intelligence) and to establish relationships of trust to underpin a Social Licence for Financial Technology. Such approaches are needed across all areas and industries of data-intensive innovation to complement regulation and inform the development of ethical codes of practice.

As a result of its consistent growth new terms have been introduced in this domain. The term 'FinTech' is one such terminology. This term is used for describing various operations that are being frequently employed in the financial technology sector. These operations are usually practiced in enterprises or organizations and provide requested services by using Information Technology based applications. The term does take into account various other sensitive issues, like, security, privacy, threats, cyber-attacks, etc. This is important to note that the development of FinTech is indebted to the mutual integration of different state of the art technologies, for example, technologies related to a mobile embedded system, mobile networks, mobile cloud computing, big data, data analytics techniques, and cloud computing etc. However, this technology is facing several security and privacy issues that are much needed to be addressed in order to improve the acceptability of this new technology among its users. In an effort to secure FinTech, this article provides a comprehensive survey of FinTech by reviewing the most recent as well as anticipated financial industry privacy and security issues. It provides a comprehensive analysis of current security issues, detection mechanisms and security solutions proposed for FinTech. Finally, it discusses future challenges to ensure the security and privacy of financial technology applications. © 2013 IEEE.","cyber security; FinTech; fraud detection; Internet of Things; privacy; security; threats","Crime; Data Analytics; Data privacy; Internet of things; Mobile cloud computing; Network security; Surveys; Comprehensive analysis; Cyber security; Fraud detection; security; Security and privacy issues; State-of-the-art technology; Technology based applications; threats; Fintech","","","","","","","Zhang, Yan, Home M2M networks: Architectures, standards, and QoS improvement, IEEE Communications Magazine, 49, 4, pp. 44-52, (2011); Gai, Keke, SA-EAST: Security-aware efficient data transmission for ITS in mobile heterogeneous cloud computing, ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems, 16, 2, (2017); Wen, Sheng, Modeling propagation dynamics of social network worms, IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems, 24, 8, pp. 1633-1643, (2013); Zhang, Jun, Internet traffic classification by aggregating correlated naive bayes predictions, IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security, 8, 1, pp. 5-15, (2013); Zhang, Yan, Performance evaluation of GSM/GPRS networks with channel re-allocation scheme, IEEE Communications Letters, 8, 5, pp. 280-282, (2004); Gai, Keke, Intrusion detection techniques for mobile cloud computing in heterogeneous 5G, Security and Communication Networks, 9, 16, pp. 3049-3058, (2016); Zhang, Qingchen, Privacy Preserving Deep Computation Model on Cloud for Big Data Feature Learning, IEEE Transactions on Computers, 65, 5, pp. 1351-1362, (2016); Abawajy, Jemal H., Trust, Security and Privacy in Emerging Distributed Systems, Future Generation Computer Systems, 55, pp. 224-226, (2016); Psannis, Kostas E., Advanced Media-Based Smart Big Data on Intelligent Cloud Systems, IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Computing, 4, 1, pp. 77-87, (2019); Plageras, Andreas P., Efficient IoT-based sensor BIG Data collection–processing and analysis in smart buildings, Future Generation Computer Systems, 82, pp. 349-357, (2018)","M.

Mapping and analysing the plethora of legal implications of rapidly further evolving financial technology have gained momentum. The paper aims to contribute to it. Focus is on the German view. The following questions have inspired the analysis: How might FinTech best be defined and its most important manifestations best be systematized for legal purposes? Have the most pressing legal issues been addressed, so far? The paper considers the legal challenges of FinTech as huge, reaching far beyond financial markets. It argues that artificial intelligence and machine learning deserve utmost attention particularly in this context. The paper postulates that the law-being well-equipped to control the complex, constantly morphing risks of financial innovation while allowing exploiting its benefits-shall not just react to but lead the transformation. The present author considers particularly legal academia responsible for continuously steering and shaping a balanced and objective discourse leading to adequate legal responses in the realm of FinTech. It is time to reassert the crucial role of law in times of deep technological change not only in financial markets. 'It is a world of change-unparalleled, unsettling, dizzying change. The certainties of yesterday are the doubts of today, and the folly and mockery of tomorrow.

We emphasize that shadow banks provide higher but riskier returns and such characteristics affect the stability of shadow deposits. In our setting, the stability of shadow deposits is influenced by two offsetting effects, namely: the patience effect, which makes investors more willing to wait because of the potentially higher returns; and the uncertainty effect, which makes investors more likely to withdraw as a result of higher risk. Under liberalized interest rates, the patience effect will erode and the uncertainty effect will be heightened because the post-liberalization higher return of traditional banks undermines the importance of the extra return of shadow deposits to depositors, while preserving the importance of the risk aspect. Fintech development is modeled as a reduction in the withdrawal cost that facilitates runs. This affects the stability of shadow deposits because of their wider fintech reliance. Regulators should be cautious in pushing interest rate liberalization and fintech application alongside building a safety net for shadow banking. © 2020 Institute of World Economics and Politics, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences","bank run; E26; E422; fintech; G18; interest rate liberalization; shadow banking","","","","","","North Carolina Central University, NCCU, (20720181045); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (20720181039, 71803163)","The authors would like to thank Yan Zeng, Qiang Gong, and Yiping Huang for helpful advice and comments.

However, fintech development can help to improve the accessibility and affordability of financial services, particularly for sections of the population formerly excluded from such services. Improved access is expected to stimulate the growth essential for promoting urbanization, possibly alleviating the negative impacts of a digital divide and creating a trickle-down effect. This paper is among the first to investigate the effect of fintech development on urbanization, as indicated by labor transfer from agricultural to non-agricultural sectors in China. It is found that: (i) the digital divide hindered, while fintech development contributed to urbanization; (ii) the positive effect of fintech development on urbanization affects individuals both with and without access to the internet, yielding the so-called trickle-down effect and thus helping to alleviate the negative consequences of a digital divide; and (iii) regarding transmission mechanisms, fintech development helps to generate additional jobs and raise income in non-agricultural sectors, stimulating urbanization even for those without access to the internet. © 2020 Institute of World Economics and Politics, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences","D14; D31; digital divide; fintech; labor transfer; R58; urbanization","","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71973014, 71833003, 71703088)","This paper was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71703088, 71833003 and 71973014).","Bazot, Guillaume, Financial consumption and the cost of finance: Measuring financial efficiency in Europe (1950-2007), Journal of the European Economic Association, 16, 1, pp. 123-160, (2018); Beck, Thorsten, Reaching out: Access to and use of banking services across countries, Journal of Financial Economics, 85, 1, pp. 234-266, (2007); Working Paper, (2011); Chen, Chunlai, Impact of Foreign Direct Investment and Export on Urbanization: Evidence from China, China and World Economy, 25, 1, pp. 71-89, (2017); China Internet Development Report, (2019); Dollar, David, Growth is good for the poor, Journal of Economic Growth, 7, 3, pp. 195-225, (2002); Jingjixue Jikan China Economic Quarterly, (2020); American Economic Review, (1970); Kapoor, Aditi, Financial inclusion and the future of the Indian economy, Futures, 56, pp. 35-42, (2014); Rise and Nature of Alternative Work Arrangements in the United States 1995 2015, (2016)","C.

In order to do so, a list of peer-reviewed journals was compiled, identified, examined, coded, and classified into high-level themes to be reviewed, analysed, and interpreted. After synthesising the notion of fintech in the literature, this article proposes several potential areas for further exploration, divided into the following themes: definition, attributes, adoption, regulation, and competition. Fintech or financial technology is a relatively new subject in the literature but commonly cited as one of the most important innovations in the financial industry.

The increasing of online loan applications is one of the impacts of these technological development. However, the problem is that there are many of these applications that do not have a license to provide financial services yet. Whereas the Financial Services Authority (OJK) in this case has required every financial technology to register a license to operate. Noted, 1,330 people reported to the Legal Aid Institute (LBH), there are 89 financial technology applications with the Peer to Peer Lending platform that are suspected of violating laws and human rights against debitors. The report indicates, the ease of lending in online applications makes customers increasingly entangled. The focus of the writer in this paper is how to protect the debitors customers against the debitors information data, as well as how to sanction applications that are arbitrary and do not yet have a granting permit from the Financial Services Authority (OJK).

Regression tests need to be applied at that application after migration or version update are required to get written again in order to resolve compatibility issues with the new technologies. A problematic scenario occurs for the automation of script-level test when an application is updated or migrated just to include the technology which is not supported by the tool in use of testing. In this case, the purpose of test automation is eradicated because the scripts for regression testing are rewritten with the scripting language of the new testing tool being utilized. In this paper, a Model-Driven Approach is presented to develop the automated testing scripts for the validation of the FinTech Web Applications.

The chapter opens with a mini case study that highlights the complexities of being a privately-owned small firm operating in a dynamic and largely unregulated web environment. The firm is relatively new to the financial sector thus augmenting the challenges that lie in reducing perceived risk in an industry that has a chequered history with customer perceptions of credibility and integrity in the financial services sector. The chapter introduces the theoretical underpinning, which draws from the trust theories and technology adoption at firm level, which is critiqued through the lens of the technology acceptance model. Concepts related to institution-based trust are discussed and managerial implications are considered for pure play firms operating online. Each section of the chapter explores these theoretical perspectives from a FinTech context. © 2020 by IGI Global.","","","","","","","","","Adams, Dennis A., Perceived usefulness, ease of use, and usage of information technology: A replication, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 16, 2, pp. 227-247, (1992); Ajzen, Icek, The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); Aldas-Manzano, Joaquin Ín, The role of consumer innovativeness and perceived risk in online banking usage, International Journal of Bank Marketing, 27, 1, pp. 53-75, (2009); Alexander, Nicholas, Retail financial services: transaction to relationship marketing, European Journal of Marketing, 34, 8, pp. 938-953, (2000); Awad, Neveen Farag, Establishing trust in electronic commerce through online word of mouth: An examination across genders, Journal of Management Information Systems, 24, 4, pp. 101-121, (2008); Baer, Michael D., Trusting the “look and feel”: Situational normality, situational aesthetics, and the perceived trustworthiness of organizations, Academy of Management Journal, 61, 5, pp. 1718-1740, (2018); Balaji, M.

Thus, the authors employ the method of generalized least square (GLS) with panel data. The sample concerns 21 African countries during (2001-2014-2017). The authors use a wide range of measures from Global Findex Database 2017, the World Bank platform, the World Bank national accounts data, and the OECD National Accounts data files base in the context of Africa. Empirical results show that FinTech is a driver of economic growth unless it is actively used in a developed digital infrastructure. In fact, the authors prove that, when financial technologies are used in both transactions (receive and made digital payment), they significantly contribute to the economic cycle. Passive use like simple consumption actions are not a significant lever for the economy. The principal contribution is to highlight that the active use of financial innovations and not passive one and the developed digital infrastructure do promote economic growth in African countries. © 2020 by IGI Global.

Open Banking Europe could probably be tasked with the creation of an industry-wide API and a harmonized environment where innovative FinTech solutions can be rolled out rapidly across the EU. APIs are mainly built on globally accepted technical standards, which allow two computer programmes to communicate with each other and create connections.

In 2013, ASEAN overtook China as the top foreign direct investment destination. Boasting the world’s fifth largest economy with over 650 million people and 400 million reaching middle class, ASEAN has commendably transitioned from a subsistence economy to product and service industries. Despite the success, many live in marginalized areas without access to banking facilities. Advancing internet capability and availability present investors an opportunity to offer financial technology, or Fintech, to meet the need for financial services in this digital era. The aim of this research is to identify the countries with the highest need for financial inclusion and, hence, the best potential for Fintech growth. The results may help governments formulate policy that improves investment competitiveness. The methodology includes identifying relevant criteria and allocating weight to each criterion to evaluate the best international markets. The findings show Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia as the countries with the highest potential.

FinTech and the integration of FinTech with other (green) technologies as well as with digitized agriculture plays an important role when it comes to, for example, SDG 12, specifically, responsible production, as it can mitigate trade-offs and enhance synergies between environmental and social SDGs, for example, 1 and 15, increasing profitability without additional use of natural resources. Important limitations and risks need to be addressed, however, for developing countries to fully benefit from the potential that FinTech holds in this context. Mitigating factors include massive infrastructure investments and large-scale capacity building. Rigorous research on economic sustainability and cost-effectiveness of newer FinTech models is needed to make sound policy recommendations. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","","agroindustry; capacity building; developing world; digitization; infrastructural development; natural resource; profitability; sustainability; sustainable development; trade-off","","","","","(W08.250.203)","This work was supported by NWO-WOTRO [project ‘Information transparency system as a low-cost scalable solution to farmers’ access to credit and services in Ghana’, Application number W08.250.203].","2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, (2025); Campbell, Bruce M., Agriculture production as a major driver of the earth system exceeding planetary boundaries, Ecology and Society, 22, 4, (2017); Rippke, Ulrike, Timescales of transformational climate change adaptation in sub-Saharan African agriculture, Nature Climate Change, 6, 6, pp. 605-609, (2016); Role of Agriculture in Poverty Reduction an Empirical Perspective, (2010); Foley, Jonathan A., Global consequences of land use, Science, 309, 5734, pp. 570-574, (2005); Climate Change 2014 Mitigation of Climate Change, (2014); Nilsson, Måns, Policy: Map the interactions between Sustainable Development Goals, Nature, 534, 7607, pp. 320-322, (2016); Hosonuma, Noriko, An assessment of deforestation and forest degradation drivers in developing countries, Environmental Research Letters, 7, 4, (2012); Herrmann, Raoul T., Competition between biofuel feedstock and food production: Empirical evidence from sugarcane outgrower settings in Malawi, Biomass and Bioenergy, 114, pp. 100-111, (2018); Delzeit, Ruth, Addressing future trade-offs between biodiversity and cropland expansion to improve food security, Regional Environmental Change, 17, 5, pp. 1429-1441, (2017)","","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","18773435","","","","English","Curr.

Due to the wide adoption of IT, various FinTech applications are used by financial industry to help process information and offer financial services. Traditionally, textual passwords are the most widely deployed authentication mechanism, while having many known limitations. As a result, there is a need to enhance the security of FinTech authentication against cyber-criminals. As an alternative, graphical passwords (GPs) are considered as one promising solution to complement traditional password-based systems. In the literature, various GP schemes were proposed such as PassPoints, DAS, Cued Click Points, GeoPass, etc. In this work, we identify that multiple password inference has become a challenge for most GP schemes, and thus design RouteMap, a map-and route-based GP to further improve the security of FinTech applications. This scheme requires users to create a route on a world map as their credentials. In the evaluation, we involved a total of 120 participants, among which 60 of them have financial (FinTech) background, and investigated the performance of RouteMap by comparing it with two similar schemes. Our results demonstrate that participants can achieve better performance using RouteMap in the aspects of both authentication accuracy and multiple password memory. Our effort attempts to complement existing studies and stimulate more research on the combination of GP and FinTech. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","FinTech application; Graphical passwords; Map passwords; Multiple password inference; Security and usability; User authentication","Finance; Maps; Authentication mechanisms; Financial industry; Graphical password; Multiple password inference; Password-based systems; Process information; Security and usabilities; User authentication; Authentication","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (830929); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020","The authors would like to thank all participants for their hard work and cooperation in the user study.

Inequality, Environmental Pollution, Earnings Management opportunities, the varieties of complex Financial Instruments, Fintech, Regulatory Fragmentation, Regulatory Capture and real-financial sector-linkages are growing around the world, and these factors can have symbiotic relationships. Within Complex System theory framework, this book analyzes these foregoing issues, and introduces new behaviour theories, Enforcement Dichotomies, and critiques of models, regulations and theories in several dimensions. The issues analyzed can affect markets, and evolutions of systems, decision-making, ""nternal Markets and risk-perception within government regulators, operating companies and investment entities, and thus they have Public Policy implications. The legal analysis uses applicable US case-law and statutes (which have been copied by many countries, and are similar to those of many common-law countries). Using Qualitative Reasoning, Capital Dynamics Theory (a new approach introduced in this book), Critical Theory and elements of Mechanism Design Theory, the book aims to enhance cross-disciplinary analysis of the above-mentioned issues; and to help researchers build better systems/Artificial-Intelligence/mathematical models in Financial Stability, Portfolio Management, Policy-Analysis, Asset Pricing, Contract Theory, Enforcement Theory and Fraud Detection. The primary audience for this book consists of university Professors, PHD students and PHD degree-holders (in industries, government agencies, financial services companies and research institutes). The book can be used as a primary or supplementary textbook for graduate courses in Regulation; Capital Markets; Law & Economics, International Political Economy and or Mechanism Design (Applied Math, Operations Research, Computer Science or Finance). © 2020 Michael I.

Design/methodology/approach: Two sets of data were used in this study in order to fill the two identified knowledge gaps. First, six years’ worth of data, for the period from September 2012 to August 2018 was collected from Google Trends. This was in the form of search term keyword text. The hypothesis was designed correspondingly, and the results were reviewed and evaluated using a relevant statistical tool. Second, relevant data were extracted from the “Indeed” website (www.indeed.co.uk) by means of a simple VBA programme written in Excel. In total, the textual data for 500 job advertisements, including the keyword “FinTech”, were downloaded from that website. Findings: The authors found that there was a continuously increasing trend in the use of the keyword “fintech” under the category “Jobs and Education” in online searching from September 2012 to August 2018. The authors demonstrated that this trend was statistically significant. In contrast, the trends for searches using both “finance” and “accounting” were slightly decreased over the same period. Furthermore, the authors identified the geographic distribution of the fintech-related jobs in the UK. In regard to job titles, the authors discovered that “manager” was the most frequently searched term, followed by “developer” and “engineer”. Research limitations/implications: Educators could use this research as a reference in the development of the portfolio of their courses. In addition, the findings from this study could also enable potential participators to reflect on their career development. It is worth noting that the motivations for carrying out an internet search are complex, and each of these needs to be understood. There are many factors that would affect how an information seeker would behave with the obtained information. More work is still needed in order to encourage more people to enter to the FinTech sector. Originality/value: In the planning stage prior to launching a new course educators often need to justify the market need: this analysis could provide a supporting rationale and enable a new course to launch more quickly. Consequently, the pipeline of talent supply to the sector would also be benefitted. The authors believe this is the first time that a study like this had been conducted to explore specifically the availability and opportunities for FinTech education and retraining in UK. The authors anticipate that this study will become the primary reference for researchers, educators and policy makers engaged in future research or practical applications on related topics. © 2019, Anna Sung, Kelvin Leong, Paolo Sironi, Tim O’Reilly and Alison McMillan.","Business innovation; Financial Technology; FinTech; Higher education; Retraining","","","","","","","","Agarwal, Ritu, The digital transformation of healthcare: Current status and the road ahead, Information Systems Research, 21, 4, pp. 796-809, (2010); Future of Finance is Emerging New Hubs New Landscapes, (2018); Boeing, Geoff, New Insights into Rental Housing Markets across the United States: Web Scraping and Analyzing Craigslist Rental Listings, Journal of Planning Education and Research, 37, 4, pp. 457-476, (2017); Pandit Says 30 of Bank Jobs May Disappear in Next Five Years, (2017); Chen, Long, From Fintech to Finlife: the case of Fintech Development in China, China Economic Journal, 9, 3, pp. 225-239, (2016); Choi, Hyunyoung, Predicting the Present with Google Trends, Economic Record, 88, SUPPL.1, pp. 2-9, (2012); Journal of Financial Perspectives, (2015); Durmuşoǧlu, Zeynep D.U., Using Google trends data to assess public understanding on the environmental risks, Human and Ecological Risk Assessment, 23, 8, pp. 1968-1977, (2017); Fintech and the Financing of Entrepreneurs from Crowdfunding to Marketplace Lending, (2017); Ginsberg, Jeremy, Detecting influenza epidemics using search engine query data, Nature, 457, 7232, pp. 1012-1014, (2009)","A.

The analysis focuses on funding resources, operational processes, assets-liability management, risks, and prices. After conducting qualitative research, the result shows that while BPR and fintech have different business models, they both have similarities in financing products. BPR should pay attention to assets and maintaining optimal liquidity level. Fintech does not burden by regulation on assets and liquidity because its financing and the distribution of fund depends on investors. Both BPR and fintech company determine loan pricing by the cost of fund and overhead. The average loan interest of BPR ranges from 21% to 24%, while average loan interest of fintech company ranges from 11% to 30% depending on the results of credit scoring analysis. BPRs are much more hampered by regulation than fintech, including the maximum extent of lending and business activities limitations based on BPR's core capital classified in its business activities. © 2019 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Financial technology; Microfinance; Rural bank; Small bank","","","","","","","","Georgetown Journal of International Law, (2015); undefined, (2016); Belleflamme, Paul, Crowdfunding: Tapping the right crowd, Journal of Business Venturing, 29, 5, pp. 585-609, (2014); Cepr Discussion Papers 4211, (2003); Diamond, Douglas W., Liquidity risk, liquidity creation, and financial fragility: A theory of banking, Journal of Political Economy, 109, 2, pp. 287-327, (2001); Mckinsey Q, (2012); undefined, (2016); Lamberti, Hermann Josef, Lessons learned: 50 years of information technology in the banking industry - The example of Deutsche Bank AG, Business and Information Systems Engineering, 51, 1, pp. 31-42, (2009); Maier, Erik, Supply and demand on crowdlending platforms: connecting small and medium-sized enterprise borrowers and consumer investors, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 33, pp. 143-153, (2016); Competition Policy and the Financial Technology Revolution in Banking, (2006)","","","Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","","","","","","","9781536162752; 9781536165302","","","English","Bus. and Manag.

In this study, based on the weighted least squares (WLS) and threshold regression methods of cross-sectional data, we empirically examine the impact of FinTech development on agricultural nonpoint source (NPS) pollution, a major cause of impaired surface water quality. Our results show that there is an inverted “U” shape relationship between the development of FinTech and agricultural NPS pollution. That is, after crossing a “threshold value”, the level of FinTech development can curb agricultural NPS pollution. At the structural level, the availability of FinTech services, the FinTech infrastructure, and the agricultural NPS pollution also have an inverted “U” shape relationship. At the threshold effect, in the developing stage of an agricultural economy, the overall level of FinTech development, the use of FinTech services, the availability of FinTech services, and the FinTech infrastructure have an inverted “U” shape relationship with agricultural NPS pollution. On the other hand, in the developed stage of an agricultural economy, the impact of FinTech development and its structure on agricultural NPS pollution is insignificant. Hence, we can conclude that FinTech development can help reduce agricultural NPS pollution in under-developed regions. However, due to the fact that a “U” shape relationship always exists between FinTech service quality and agricultural NPS pollution, the quality of FinTech service should be the main focus to reduce agricultural NPS pollution more effectively. © 2019 by the authors.

The term FinTech emerged in 1972, as an acronym of Financial Technologies, is often described as amalgamation of financial services using technological evolutions, and its usage was earlier limited to banking sector deploying modern management Science and Computers (Bettinger, 1972, p.62). Fintech was mainly restricted to back-office processes of banks leveraging software and applications to manage customer accounts and their transactions in a secured, centralized, and efficient way. Micu (2016), referred Fintech as a new paradigm of technology to facilitate business, international trade, and services offered to retail consumers. Schueffel (2016) conceptualized FinTech as a technological encapsulation of Financial Sector rather than a technology. Smartphones with high speed Internet has triggered the growth of Fintech through customer facing apps. Takahashi (2018), predicted that global smartphone usage will surpass 3.8 billion by the end of year 2021, accounting for 48% of the global population.

However, relevant studies are rare and there is no consensus on the optimal indicator system for sustainable development. Therefore, this study proposes an indicator system to evaluate sustainability and conducts in-depth analysis of the relationship between FinTech and sustainable development based on data of peer-to-peer platforms (P2P) in 31 Chinese provinces. The empirical results show the existence of a U-shaped relationship between FinTech and sustainable development, mainly determined by the pattern of extensive economic growth. Furthermore, heterogeneity analysis indicates that there are significant regional differences in its impact on sustainable development, being significant in China's eastern and central regions and insignificant in the western region; moreover, the impact on the central region is significantly higher than that on the eastern region. Our research not only has strong practical significance but also contributes significantly to the literature on FinTech and sustainable development. © 2019 by the authors.","Consumption emission; Economic growth; Environmental governance; Financial technology; Peer-to-peer; Social development; Sustainable development","economic growth; empirical analysis; environmental economics; environmental legislation; financial system; heterogeneity; literature review; optimization; social development; sustainability; sustainable development; China","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71473169, 71673194, 71742004); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Sichuan University, SCU; Graduate Student's Research and Innovation Fund of Sichuan University, (2018YJSY001); Graduate Student's Research and Innovation Fund of Sichuan University","Funding: This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant Nos. 71742004, 71673194, and 71473169 for D.X. and the Graduate Student’s Research and Innovation Fund of Sichuan University, Grant No.2018YJSY001 for C.X.

This term covers a large range of techniques, from data security to financial service. Specially, user privacy protection is generally considered one of the most significant aspects in the financial security domain and preserving data carrying privacy is a critical task in producing a privacy protection strategy, e.g., one of the crucial issues in mobile finance is to ensure the legitimate mobile device users can efficiently search inclusive information from servers without leaking the user privacy. More precisely, more and more mobile finance APP(e.g., AliPay, China Unionpay Quick Pass) has the auxiliary tool or third-party services function that enable users make a location-based services(LBS) query, while the LBS usually carry users’ location privacy and that data of service providers should be accessed by legitimate users. In order to address this problem, in this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving LBS framework which supports the query area is a square area based on the user's location, and achieves fine-grained access control on the financial service provider data, user's privacy(especially location privacy), confidentiality of the service provider data, and accurate query result. More precisely, our framework also uses redundant point-of-interesting(POI) records to protect privacy against LBS provider(LBSP), but employs a semi-trusted third party(called proxy) to filter out redundant POI records. We propose a novel blind filter protocol based on comparable attribute-based encryption(CABE) and “transformation” technique, which can filter out the encrypted POI records under the condition that both LBSP and proxy without knowing the user's location information. In comparison with existing solutions, our framework not only realize access control on service provider data innately, but also incurs lower communication and computation overhead on the user side. The analysis and the experiments indicate that our framework is secure and efficient for mobile devices in terms of computation and the communication overhead. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","0-encoding; 1-encoding; Access control; Attribute-based encryption; FinTech; LBS; Location privacy; Privacy-preserving","Access control; Cryptography; Data privacy; Finance; Location; Mobile security; Telecommunication services; 0-encoding; 1-encoding; Attribute-based encryptions; FinTech; Location privacy; Privacy preserving; Location based services","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61402015, 61502044, 61702212); Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province, (F2018408040); Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province, (ZR201702180067); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (CCNU19TS017)","This work was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [no. 61502044 , 61402015 , 61702212 ]; the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [no.

We use e-payment index introduced by RMIT University and TRPC and apply quantile regression with GME approach. We consider the quantile level at 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75. At the low level of economic development variables, the Fintech have the highest effects on these variables compared with the medium and high level of economic development. In other words, Fintech supports not only low level of growth and productivity but also reduce the low level of price volatility and income inequity. Further investigation provides that e-payment usage and technology empowerment are helpful to economic development, particularly, increasing in growth and productivity. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

In particular, this article seeks to demonstrate that vertical agreements can produce novel solutions in certain fintech markets, whilst also creating potential novel issues around exclusion, bundling and market power when used in the context of blockchain technologies. It is hoped that the results of the public consultation will bring some of these issues to the Commission’s attention, because without taking these issues into consideration the Commission risks missing the opportunity to make ex ante changes to the VBER to ensure that it is ready for potential future innovations in the digital economy. © 2019 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd.","Blockchain; Fintech; Reform; Restraints; Vertical agreements","","","","","","","","","","","Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd.","","","","","","14769085","","","","English","Compet.

The methodology adapted in this paper is qualitative secondary research case study method. The study undertook a literature review analysis where the literature of more than fifty research papers and reports were analyzed and themes were generated. Hence twelve such themes evolved and then thematic content analysis was executed through grounded theory method. The reliability of the data source mentioned were taken from relevant organizations involved in cross border payments and validation of the reports were done by experts in this field of financial ecosystem. SWIFT still enjoys monopoly in the market in terms of its huge network and the number of banks it partners across 200 + countries in the world. But the new block chain technology launched by Ripple and Bitcoin and other small start-ups has posed a challenge to the existing traditional cross border payment system of SWIFT. Block chain has a peer-to-peer communication with no intermediary network required. It involves a simple transaction charge with the flexibility to share documents over network for better transparency. But SWIFT having a legacy incredibility and trust can ensure more reliable services to the businesses in cross border payments. © BEIESP.","Digital payment; Incredibility; Monopoly; SWIFT","","","","","","","","Plastics, (1964); Linear Networks and Systems Book Style, (1993); An Introduction to Signal Detection and Estimation, (1994); An Approach to Graphs of Linear Forms Unpublished Work Style; IEEE Trans Antennas Propagat; undefined; undefined, (1995); Yorozu, Tomoko, Electron Spectroscopy Studies on Magneto-Optical Media and Plastic Substrate Interface, 2, 8, pp. 740-741, (1987); Technical Writer S Handbook, (1989); Networks, (1991)","S.

To analyze the role of fintech in the national economy, we first broaden its definition and compare its economic performance using three methodologies-Demand-driven model, Supply-driven model and industry linkage effect in interindustry analysis. We find that the fintech industry has a stronger effect on production inducement. Regarding industry linkage effects, fintech ranked the top in all 31 industries for the forward linkage effect and 22 for the background linkage effect-much higher than the traditional financial industry. This implies that the fintech industry is effective as the intermediate good with national demand as well as the final good. Particularly, this industry plays the roles of intermediate and final goods across almost all industries. That is, fintech could better promote overall national economic performance as a platform industry. Because most businesses within the fintech industry depend on innovation through the integration of finance and information technology, we find that fintech can feasibly prompt the fourth industrial revolution. Nonetheless, this industry is characterized by excessive regulations in Korea, indicating the need for negative regulation for new, innovative businesses within the fintech industry that would critically emphasize innovativeness for inclusive, sustainable economic growth. © 2019 by the authors.","Exogenous specification; Fintech; Innovation; Input-output analysis; Sustainable growth","demand analysis; economic conditions; economic growth; finance; information technology; innovation; input-output analysis; national economy; sustainability; Korea","","","","","Inha University, Inha","Funding: Inha University Research Fund supported this work.","Basole, Rahul C., Transformation through unbundling: Visualizing the global FinTech ecosystem, Service Science, 10, 4, pp. 379-396, (2018); undefined; What is Fintech Huffington Post; Lee, In, Fintech: Ecosystem, business models, investment decisions, and challenges, Business Horizons, 61, 1, pp. 35-46, (2018); Fintech Opportunity, (2016); Fintech Trends Towatch in 2019 Cb Insights; Pwc Global Fintech Survey, (2017); Plus of Fintech, (2018); Georgetown Journal of International Law, (2015); Gomber, Peter, On the Fintech Revolution: Interpreting the Forces of Innovation, Disruption, and Transformation in Financial Services, Journal of Management Information Systems, 35, 1, pp. 220-265, (2018)","Y.

It is argued that situating this emergent ‘turn to technology’ in the context of a longer-running pattern of failed efforts to promote the development of financial markets for the poor in the Global South offers us a useful lens on the dynamics of neoliberalism. The article develops this analysis by drawing together interlinked discussions of ‘neoliberal reason’, highlighting the central role played by the diffusion of market institutions in neoliberal projects with Marxian discussions highlighting the crucial underlying role of labour in enabling the operation of markets. In this context the appeal to ever-more fine-grained information with which to allocate credit underlying the turn to technology can both be read as yet another attempt to ‘re-engineer’ the market, and also seen as a doomed project. Empirically, this argument is fleshed out through an engagement with key framework documents around financial inclusion and technology from the World Bank and G20. © The Author(s) 2019.","development; financial inclusion; Fintech; markets; neoliberalism; poverty","European Union; financial market; governance approach; neoliberalism; poverty; World Bank","","","","","","","undefined, (2010); undefined, (2011); undefined, (2018); Aitken, Rob, The financialization of micro-credit, Development and Change, 44, 3, pp. 473-499, (2013); Aitken, Rob, All data is credit data': Constituting the unbanked, Competition and Change, 21, 4, pp. 274-300, (2017); undefined, (2015); undefined, (2015); Bateman, Milford, Why Doesn't Microfinance Work?: The Destructive Rise of Local Neoliberalism, pp. 1-262, (2010); Bateman, Milford, The Rise and Fall of Global Microcredit: Development, debt and disillusion, pp. 1-288, (2018); Beer, David, The social power of algorithms, Information Communication and Society, 20, 1, pp. 1-13, (2017)","N.

The contributions of SMEs in many countries' gross domestic product (GDP) have been overwhelming. SMEs improve job creation in all sectors of the economy and contribute to the people's economic wellbeing. However, many SMEs are not getting financing from their respective counties due to strict regulations and interest rate hike. With this kind of regulations and high interest, many brains are wasted, and many ideas are vanishing with the job opportunities attached them. Government agencies are therefore in need to innovate different ways to facilitate SME financing and support new businesses for achieving and maintaining sustainable economic growth.

In addition, the authors find empirical support for the FinTech's role as a driver of economic growth and a breeding ground for innovative projects in a context of freedom of expression, association, and media.

The impact of technological developments leads to a new business models that disrupts their predecessors. Financial Technology (FinTech) is one example of a new business model in the financial world that is predicted to disrupt the banking business model. Hence, it is important to do a study on the potential switching of traditional bank's customers to FinTech lending services using Push-Pull-Mooring (PPM) framework. The samples in this study were banking customers covering conventional and Islamic banks domiciled in Jakarta, Indonesia and the data was later analyzed using multinomial logistic regression (MLR). The results showed that PPM effects suggested that there was a tendency of traditional banks' customers to switch to FinTech lending services. It was revealed that the potential of traditional bank's customers who may be moving to FinTech lending services is 98.82 percent.

YuEbao is selected as the subject as it is a representative example of FinTech services in China. Design/methodology/approach: A survey questionnaire was deployed and a ten-point sliding scale with two-decimal points was applied to improve the accuracy of the questionnaire. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. Findings: Trust in service and structural assurance can encourage continuance intention of FinTech service. System quality, situational normality and subjective norm can boost the development of trust in service. Both herding and subjective norm can affect structural assurance significantly. Research limitations/implications: The study highlights the important roles played by technical factors (i.e. situational normality and system quality) and social factors (i.e. herding and subjective norm) in developing the two levels of trust (i.e. trust in service and structural assurance). It also validates the influences of trust in service and structural assurance on encouraging customers’ continuance intention in the novel context of FinTech. Practical implications: The findings of this study can be used by practitioners to encourage customers to continue using their FinTech services. To encourage continuance, service providers can improve the quality of their system, design the system to be aligned with customers’ using habits and show customers that their close friends are also using the service. Originality/value: This study adds to the existing body of trust literature by investigating the direct effects of trust in service and structure assurance on continuance intention and how these two levels of trust are developed from technical and social aspects. It generates interesting insights into customers’ continuance behavior of FinTech services. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Continuance intention; FinTech; Herding; Structural assurance; Subjective norm; Trust","Least squares approximations; Sales; Social aspects; Surveys; Continuance intentions; Herding; Structural assurance; Subjective norm; Trust; Fintech","","","","","","","ALqasa, Khaled Mohammed Ahmed, The impact of students' attitude and subjective norm on the behavioural intention to use services of banking system, International Journal of Business Information Systems, 15, 1, pp. 105-122, (2014); Georgetown Journal of International Law, (2015); Bao, Haijun, Repurchase intention in the Chinese e-marketplace: Roles of interactivity, trust and perceived effectiveness of e-commerce institutional mechanisms, Industrial Management and Data Systems, 116, 8, pp. 1759-1778, (2016); Beck, Thorsten, Reaching out: Access to and use of banking services across countries, Journal of Financial Economics, 85, 1, pp. 234-266, (2007); Beck, Thorsten, Banking services for everyone?

It also predicts that personal and sociodemographic variables (familiarity with robots, age, gender and country) moderate the main relationships. Design/methodology/approach: Data from a web survey of 765 North American, British and Portuguese potential users of robo-advisor services confirm the validity of the measurement scales and provide the input for structural equation modeling and multisample analyses of the hypotheses. Findings: Consumers’ attitudes toward robo-advisors, together with mass media and interpersonal subjective norms, are found to be the key determinants of adoption. The influences of perceived usefulness and attitude are slightly higher for users with a higher level of familiarity with robots; in turn, subjective norms are significantly more relevant for users with a lower familiarity and for customers from Anglo-Saxon countries. Practical implications: Banks and other firms in the finance industry should design robo-advisors to be used by a wide spectrum of consumers. Marketing tactics applied should consider the customer’s level of familiarity with robots. Originality/value: This research identifies the key drivers of robo-advisor adoption and the moderating effect of personal and sociodemographic variables. It contributes to understanding consumers’ perceptions regarding the introduction of AI in FinTech. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial Intelligence; Finance; Robo-advisors; Robots; Technology adoption","Finance; Fintech; Intelligent robots; Robots; Sales; Design/methodology/approach; Perceived usefulness; Potential customers; Research frameworks; Robo-advisors; Socio-demographic variables; Structural equation modeling; Technology adoption; Artificial intelligence","","","","","","","Robots and Jobs Evidence from US Labor Markets, (2017); Ajzen, Icek, The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); Algesheimer, René, The social influence of brand community: Evidence from European car clubs, Journal of Marketing, 69, 3, pp. 19-34, (2005); Anderson, James C., Structural Equation Modeling in Practice: A Review and Recommended Two-Step Approach, Psychological Bulletin, 103, 3, pp. 411-423, (1988); Bagozzi, Richard P., The legacy of the technology acceptance model and a proposal for a paradigm shift, Journal of the Association for Information Systems, 8, 4, pp. 244-254, (2007); Bagozzi, Richard P., Open source software user communities: A study of participation in Linux user groups, Management Science, 52, 7, pp. 1099-1115, (2006); Belanche, Daniel, Understanding the influence of social information sources on e-government adoption, Information Research, 17, 3, (2012); Belanche, Daniel, The effect of culture in forming e-loyalty intentions: A cross-cultural analysis between Argentina and Spain, BRQ Business Research Quarterly, 18, 4, pp. 275-292, (2015); Belanche, Daniel, Determinants of multi-service smartcard success for smart cities development: A study based on citizens' privacy and security perceptions, Government Information Quarterly, 32, 2, pp. 154-163, (2015); Belanche, Daniel, Reciprocity and commitment in online travel communities, Industrial Management and Data Systems, 119, 2, pp. 397-411, (2019)","C.

Unfortunately, according to Jakpat Survey in 2018 said that until 2018, there's still no adoption of financial technology in health services. This paper aimed to determine the important factors of financial technology adoption by hospital clustering with Fuzzy Analytical Network Process (FANP) method. This paper used the questionnaire from 35 hospital experts as the respondents from all around Indonesia. Scope data in this paper came from outpatient unit administration payment in Hospital. Fuzzy Analytical Network Process (ANP) were used to find the most significant factor from Technology, Organization, Environment, Human (TOEH) framework. This paper found that the most important factor and sub-factor for the hospitals in cluster 1 were technology and compatibility. Meanwhile, for the hospitals in the cluster 2, the most important factor was environment and the most important sub-factor was government pressure. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Finance; Hospitals; Risk management; Surveys; Systems engineering; Fuzzy analytical network process; Health services; Importance factors; Indonesia; Money transactions; Technology adoption; Fuzzy logic","","","","","","","Journal of Indonesian Economy and Business, (2016); Fintech the Technology Driving Disruption in the Financial Services Industry, (2007); Fintech Report 2018, (2018); Jumlah Transaksi Uang Elektronik Beredar, (2018); Dachyar, M., Patients' Loyalty Improvement in Public Hospital, MATEC Web of Conferences, 248, (2018); Jumlah Rumah Sakit Di Indonesia, (2018); Jakpat Survey Report Internet, (2016); Jakpat Survey Report Internet, (2018); Nilashi, Mehrbakhsh, Determining the importance of Hospital Information System adoption factors using Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (ANP), Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 111, pp. 244-264, (2016); Siregar, Eveline, Determining Criteria of Human Resource Information System that Affect Human Resource Performance in Companies Using DEMATEL-Based ANP Method, MATEC Web of Conferences, 248, (2018)","M.

Previous critical accounts have often linked the development of fintech to processes of financialization. However, these arguments rarely take account of the uneven and highly limited character of ‘financial inclusion’ in practice. Drawing on engagements with science and technology studies and historical materialist political economy, this article advances an approach emphasizing processes of abstraction from productive activities, mediated through particular infrastructures, as core elements of financial accumulation. Seen in this light, psychometrics in particular and alternative credit data more broadly can be seen as flawed efforts to confront three sets of limits—(1) the necessarily reductive character of abstract framings, and the consequent challenges posed by their encounter with complex processes in practice, (2) the ways that systems for credit scoring interact with the infrastructures of existing financial systems, and (3) the difficulty of realizing financial profits in the context of widespread precarious livelihoods. Looking at alternative forms of credit data from this angle offers a way of grasping the truncated and uneven rollout of fintech, and hence of prompting more critical reflections about the limits to processes of financialization. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","credit scoring; Financial inclusion; financialization; historical materialism; psychometrics; science and technology studies; technology","","","","","","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC, (756-2016-0297); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, Postdoctoral Fellowship 756-2016-0297.

Various industries in the world, including Indonesia, have been disrupted by digital transformation. One industry that has been disrupted by digital transformation is the application of information technology in financial services, namely financial technology in the digital payment section. The ease and convenience provided by financial technology needs to be followed by responsible use, financial technology services need to facilitate their users to have a healthy financial behavior. After conducting user research using questionnaire, users feel that the ease that comes with the application can result in consumerism. In this paper, we present the result of our observation in designing the user interactions of a financial technology mobile application added with a new feature called budget control. The user-centered design approach is used to design the high-fidelity prototype of the application based on the users' needs. The prototype is designed based on usability goals and user-experience goals defined for the users. We conduct a usability testing to evaluate the prototype using system usability scale questionnaire, single easy question questionnaire, and user interviews. The results show that the prototype fulfills the usability and user-experience goals. © 2019 IEEE.","budget control; consumerism; financial technology; interaction; mobile application; prototype; user-centered design","Budget control; Fintech; Mobile computing; Service industry; Surveys; Usability engineering; User centered design; User interfaces; Application of information technologies; Digital transformation; Financial service; Mobile applications; Technological process; Technology service; User interaction design; User-centered design approaches; User experience","","","","","","","Financial Technology, (2013); Fintech Indonesia; Orang Indonesia Makin Konsumtif, (2015); New Fintech Report Highlights Indonesia S Untapped Digital Finance Opportunity, (2018); User Centered Design, (2013); Handbook of Usability Testing, (1994); Analisis Dan Perancangan Aplikasi Mobile Pada Sistem Layanan Audit Retail Berdasarkan User Centered Design Studi Kasus Pt, (2018); Perancangan Interaksi E Commerce Custom Design Merch Dengan Pendekatan User Centered Design Disertai Akomodasi Pengguna Buta Warna, (2018); Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting, (2002); Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia, (2025)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2019 International Conference on Advanced Informatics: Concepts, Theory, and Applications, ICAICTA 2019","2019-09-20 through 2019-09-22","Yogyakarta","159182","","9781728134505","","","English","Proc. - Int.

FinTech 2.0 companies are able to capture more of the payment economics and offer merchants a better experience. While a software company can pursue multiple pathways to offer payments to its customers, the only way to fully capture the benefits of FinTech 2.0 is to become a payment facilita-tor (payfac).

In this respect, the paper discusses the role of such drivers as increasing regulation, digitalisation, the drive for efficiency, and the general lack of agility among incumbent financial services providers to respond to changing corporate needs and expectations. The paper also discusses how these factors have driven financial institutions to invest in and partner with specialist FinTechs, and consequently, elevated investment levels and investor interest in the B2B FinTech space. The paper describes how these trends are likely to develop in the future and how it will become ever more important for incumbent financial services providers to partner with FinTechs to offer niche and tailored solutions to remain competitive. This paper also discusses what the future will look like and how the landscape will look signifi-cantly more intricate in the future. Consequently, the authors discuss how consolidation within the B2B FinTech space is expected to continue, while the emergence of tech giants in the financial services space represents the potential for a TechFin future. © Henry Stewart Publications, 1750-1806.","B2B FinTech; Cooperation; Future of FinTech; Investment; Payments; Regulation","","","","","","European Environment Agency, EEA; European Chiropractors' Union, ECU","PSD2 is requiring banks and payment service providers throughout the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA) to grant approved third-party","Pulse of Fintech, (2019); Pwcs 2018 Digital Banking Consumer Survey Mobile Users Set the Agenda, (2018); Middle Market Companies Progressing Toward Digital B2b Payments Adoption, (2019); Bank of the Future, (2018); Synergy and Disruption Ten Trends Shaping Fintech, (2018); What do Corporate Banking Customers Really Want, (2018); Fintech Bridges Across the Globe, (2019); Fintech Cooperation Agreements, (2019); London on Track to Become Global Fintech Hub, (2019); Ireland Must Aim to Be A Fintech Hub Available at Https Www Independent Ie Business Irish Derek Kehoe Ireland Must Aim to Be A Fintech Hub 38235274 Html Accessed 2nd July 2019, (2019)","","","Henry Stewart Publications 28-30 Little Russel Street London WC1A 2HN","","","","","","17501806","","","","English","J.

The increasingly tech-savvy demography is presenting both opportunities and challenges to the industry. With the advances in e-finance and mobile technologies, financial technology (Fintech) innovations emerged by combining the e-finance, Internet, social networking services, social media, artificial intelligence (AI) and big data analytics. Fintech promises to reshape the Islamic financial landscape by improving processes' efficiencies, cost-effectiveness, increased distribution, Sharīah compliance and financial inclusion. As far as the Islamic fund management industry is concerned, AI seems to be the keyword. Islamic fund managers have recently started to incorporate AI and big data analytics into their strategy in the process of making accurate decisions based on facts and figures, which eliminates any biases and personal intuition. This disruption in status quo is raising new issues, new concerns and new exciting opportunities. While disruption may carry negative connotations, the industry players have been embracing the innovation and potential revolution the technology could offer. Thus, the objective of this chapter is to discuss legal aspects of Fintech and its impact on the Islamic fund management industry in Malaysia. This chapter introduces a historical overview of Fintech and its evolution in the Islamic fund management industry. This chapter further provides an overview of the legal and regulatory aspects of Fintech with regards to the industry. Finally, legal issues and challenges are identified and discussed. Being a legal research, this chapter adopts a qualitative method by analysing the relevant literatures on the subject.

Furthermore, Fintech has developed to be an unavoidable area in the Islamic finance industry. Therefore, this chapter seeks to analyse the development of Fintech in the Islamic finance industry and its connection to Islamic economics, as well as the impact towards existing regulatory mechanisms. While the scarcity of studies on this area is apparent, the authors have identified the undebatable need to regulate the development of the Fintech industry and its effects while analysing the drawbacks and positive effects of Fintech towards parties involved in the Islamic finance industry. This chapter objectively studies the phenomenon of Islamic Fintech globally with emphasis on Malaysia through analytical research methods by utilising existing facts and findings on Fintech to make proposals for possible issues identified. Existing legal frameworks are studied and scrutinised to determine whether they can accommodate the rapidly evolving Fintech. The new Regulatory Sandbox by Malaysia's central bank and existing laws are also examined. It is found that there is a room for improvement to the current regulatory framework. © 2019 by Emerald Publishing Limited.

However, the state of the testing practice in the FinTech industry still heavily relies on manual efforts. Our recent research efforts contributed our previous approach as the first attempt to automate the testing process in China Foreign Exchange Trade System (CFETS) Information Technology Co. Ltd., a subsidiary of Chinas Central Bank that provides Chinas foreign exchange transactions, and revealed that automating test generation for such complex trading platform could help alleviate some of these manual efforts. In this paper, we investigate further the dilemmas faced in testing the CFETS trading platform, identify the importance of domain knowledge in its testing process, and propose a new approach of domain-specific test generation to further improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our previous approach in industrial settings.

The fast development of fintech startups on creating payment gateway and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending applications is one of examples for the modern disruptive innovations affecting to traditional financial business. The problem arises when the digital disruption affects the bank's business models due to change in customer trends with additional impacts to conventional companies. This paper presents the quantitative approaches like statistical hypothesis testing and analysis of regression using convenient random sampling for better analyzing the impacts of fintech on conventional banking industry in Indonesia. A number of important and realistic variables, such as customer satisfaction, net promotion score, promotion, ease of use, etc., were considered in this research in order to find a variety of the value propositions that dominantly influence to the adoption of fintech or banking products. The results show that the banks have been disrupted by the payment fintech since the emergence of fintech companies in around 2015, mainly due to superior value propositions, like promotion with standardized beta value of 0.349 and wide range of merchants with 0.153, respectively. In addition, the fintech startups have digital strategies on adopting a customer-centric mindset and developing a product that gives their customer a high customer satisfaction. However, in the current time, P2P fintechs do not have that significant disruption to the banks, mainly due to the fact that the customers consider more on safety reasons. © 2019 IEEE.","analysis of regression; customer satisfaction; digital disruption; net promoter score; payment gateway; peer-to-peer","Information management; Peer to peer networks; Sales; Sampling; Testing; analysis of regression; digital disruption; net promoter score; Payment gateways; Peer to peer; Customer satisfaction","","","","","","","Gomber, Peter, On the Fintech Revolution: Interpreting the Forces of Innovation, Disruption, and Transformation in Financial Services, Journal of Management Information Systems, 35, 1, pp. 220-265, (2018); Peer to Peer Lending is Poised to Grow, (2014); International Journal of Management and Applied Science Ijmas, (2018); Journal of Financial Transformation, (2016); International Journal of Information Business and Management, (2018); Boot, Arnoud W.

The number of KoinWorks mobile application users is increasing however there are still some obstacles along the way. Canceled order rates of KoinWorks are still quite high. In 2017, there are only 7,5% of the total users who actually did the transaction. In addition, the result of a preliminary study conducted on 114 respondents shows that nearly 75% of the users find it difficult to use the application. This study aims to evaluate the usability of KoinWorks mobile application, to analyze the existing usability problem, and to achieve a better usability interface design. Usability is measured using both quantitative and qualitative measurements. The quantitative measurement comprises user performance metrics such as task success, time on task and error that measure effectiveness and efficiency of the mobile application as well as saccade on eye tracking. The qualitative measurements include the System Usability Scale questionnaire (SUS), Questionnaire for User Interface Satisfaction (QUIS) and Retrospective Think Aloud (RTA).

This paper concentrates on protecting sensitive rules when we assume that binary decision trees will be the models to be induced by the shared data. The suggested heuristic hiding technique is preferred over other heuristic solutions such as output disturbance or encryption methods that restrict data usability, as the raw data itself can then more easily be offered for access by any third parties. In this article, we present a paradigm of using the Local Distortion Hiding (LDH) algorithm in a real-life financial data set to hide a sensitive rule. © 2019 IEEE.","Data mining; Decision tree rules; Gain ratio; Information gain; Local distortion hiding; Local distortion hiding; Privacy-preserving","Benchmarking; Binary trees; Cryptography; Data mining; Decision trees; Finance; Heuristic methods; Binary decision trees; Financial institution; Gain Ratio; Heuristic solutions; Information gain; Local distortion; Privacy preserving; Technology application; Trees (mathematics)","","","","","","","Verykios, Vassilios S., State-of-the-art in privacy preserving data mining, SIGMOD Record, 33, 1, pp. 50-57, (2004); Brumen, Boštjan, Outsourcing medical data analyses: Can technology overcome legal, privacy, and confidentiality issues?, Journal of Medical Internet Research, 15, 12, (2013); Agrawal, Rakesh, Privacy-preserving data mining, SIGMOD Record, 29, 2, pp. 439-450, (2000); Journal of Computing, (2010); Vaidya, Jaideep S., Privacy-preserving decision trees over vertically partitioned data, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3654, pp. 139-152, (2005); Katsarou, Aliki, Reconstruction-based classification rule hiding through controlled data modification, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing, 296, pp. 449-458, (2009); Proceedings of the 19th Australian Database Conference, (2008); Delis, Aggelos, A data perturbation approach to sensitive classification rule hiding, Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on Applied Computing, pp. 605-609, (2010); Liu, Li, Privacy preserving decision tree mining from perturbed data, (2009); Kalles, Dimitris, Data set operations to hide decision tree rules, ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, 29-30-August-2016, (2016)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","10th International Conference on Information, Intelligence, Systems and Applications, IISA 2019","2019-07-15 through 2019-07-17","Patras","154245","","9781728149592","","","English","Int.

Due to their nature, FinTech products can be used within the dedicated regulatory framework or into the deep layers of the Internet. This feature of FinTech alone could potentially undermine the existing financial services regulation (FSR), the aim of which is to ensure financial stability through investor protection measures and measures protecting the integrity of the financial market. To this end, much of the illegal activities on the Dark Web have an interconnected and cross-sectorial impact on the FSR’s aims—for example, the on-going problem with stealing of personal data has implications on investor protection, often via market manipulation channels. Such considerations make it relevant to analyse the ways FinTech used on the Dark Web could affect traditional and FinTech activities in the financial sector. How strong this impact could be would probably depend on how ubiquitous FinTech innovations are on the Deep or Dark Web. This article will argue that by definition their market presence is not only across the entire Internet, but also very high in volume. This is all the more the case because FinTechs brainchild, the cryptos, have become the go to currency for many activities outside the law. © 2019, Europäische Rechtsakademie (ERA).","Cryptos; Financial market; FinTech","","","","","","","","undefined, (2016); undefined; Esas Warn Consumers of Risks in Buying Virtual Currencies, (2018); Esma Market Abuse and Accepted Market Practices, (2019); undefined, (2018); Proposal for A Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on European Crowdfunding Service Providers Ecsp for Business, (2018); undefined, (2017); undefined; undefined, (2015); undefined","M.

Such responses and strategies are crucial for deterring future attacks, particularly in the financial and critical infrastructure sectors. However, existing approaches generally rely on manual analysis of attack indicators obtained through approaches such as trace-back, firewalls, intrusion detection and honeypot deployments. These attack indicators, also known as low-level Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), are rarely re-used and can be easily modified and disguised resulting in a deceptive and biased cyber threat attribution. Cyber attackers, particularly financially-motivated actors, can use common high-level attack patterns that evolve less frequently as compared to the low-level IOCs. To attribute cyber threats effectively, it is necessary to identify them based on the high-level adversary's attack patterns (e.g. tactics, techniques and procedures - TTPs, software tools and malware) employed in different phases of the cyber kill chain. Identification of high-level attack patterns is time-consuming, requiring forensic investigation of the victim network(s) and other resources. In the rare case that attack patterns are reported in cyber threat intelligence (CTI) reports, the format is textual and unstructured typically taking the form of lengthy incident reports prepared for human consumption (e.g. prepared for C-level and senior management executives), which cannot be directly interpreted by machines. Thus, in this paper we propose a framework to automate cyber threat attribution. Specifically, we profile cyber threat actors (CTAs) based on their attack patterns extracted from CTI reports, using the distributional semantics technique of Natural Language Processing. Using these profiles, we train and test five machine learning classifiers on 327 CTI reports collected from publicly available incident reports that cover events from May 2012 to February 2018. It is observed that the CTA profiles obtained attribute cyber threats with a high precision (i.e. 83% as compared to other publicly available CTA profiles, where the precision is 33%). The Deep Learning Neural Network (DLNN) based classifier also attributes cyber threats with a higher accuracy (i.e. 94% as compared to other classifiers). © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Cyber threat attribution; Cyber threat intelligence; Deep learning neural network; FinTech threat attribution; Machine learning; Tactics techniques and procedures","Deep neural networks; Gages; Intrusion detection; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Natural language processing systems; Network security; Semantics; Cyber threats; Distributional semantics; FinTech threat attribution; Forensic investigation; Human consumption; Learning neural networks; NAtural language processing; Tactics techniques and procedures; Malware","","","","","IEEE Foundation, IEEE, (ESORICS); IEEE Foundation, IEEE; University of Texas at San Antonio, UTSA; Fulbright Association","K.-K.R.

Traditional curricula of Finance had been built upon the framework of classic Economics, and this model started falling short providing qualified graduates to the financial workforce as the landscape changed. Financial Technology (FinTech) was the response, a newborn approach designed to address the gap. The curricula of conventional financial subjects lacked the practicality for studies, and the link between teaching and assessment needed revisiting. FinTech addresses the practicality and the link through carefully considering the transferability of applicable skills taught in education, Industry-Academia Collaboration, simply meaning to prepare students with practical skills that align with needs from the industry. This paper proposes a new curriculum model of FinTech based on the integration of teaching and talent needs from the finance industry. Practice is infused into the model, to which the step of corporation assessment of practice is introduced. This curriculum covers three parts, which are: 1) curriculum framework, 2) creativity of curriculum structure, and 3) assessment of practice. The subject construction and development of FinTech are discussed and elaborated from the above three perspectives. Curriculum development aims to create an educational environment where the needs from the industry are addressed and combined into the pedagogy. © 2019 ACM.","Curriculum Development; FinTech; Industry-Academia Collaboration","Education computing; Educational technology; Fintech; Students; Curriculum development; Curriculum models; Curriculum structure; Educational environment; Finance industries; Financial industry; Integrating information; Teaching and assessments; Curricula","","","","","","","Kpmg International Retrieved, (2018); Kpmg International Cooperative, (2018); Financial Theory and Practice; Journal of Anqing Teachers College Social Science Edition, (2016); Shanghai Finance; Journal of the Staff and Worker S University; Education Modernization, (2019); Education Modernization, (2018); Journal of Hangzhou Finance Institute; China University Teaching","","","Association for Computing Machinery","","2019 International Conference on Modern Educational Technology, ICMET 2019","2019-06-28 through 2019-06-30","Nanjing","150197","21531633","9781450377881; 9781450385855; 9781450314398; 9781450396387; 9781450390019; 9781450390217; 9781450348270; 9781450381963; 9781450322485; 9781450348201","","","English","ACM Int.

In order to discover the factors that influenced the propensity to apply for FinTech loans, a theoretical model was designed, which was tested by means of a survey given to individuals who might contract loans. Design/methodology/approach: The final sample consisted of 507 individuals whose data were analyzed through structural equation modeling (SEM), with estimation of partial least squares. Findings: From the results of the research, it was possible to draw a profile of the FinTechs of Brazilian loans and also to estimate the antecedents of the propensity to utilize this type of service. Research limitations/implications: The model proposed in this work was developed to measure the propensity to consume in relation to the credit services offered by lending FinTechs. Practical implications: The consumer should intensify the use of these channels to shape financial products and services to their needs, thereby democratizing access to credit, which is often restricted in quantity and quality by policies of institutions that dominate the Brazilian lending market. Originality/value: Aspects such as trust, personal innovation, perceived utility, ease of use and social influence, as well as the constructs that precede them like privacy, stigma and transactional distance, explain 41.5 percent of the propensity to use services from lending FinTechs in Brazil. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","FinTechs lending; Propensity to consume; Startups","","","","","","","","Agarwal, Ritu, A Conceptual and Operational Definition of Personal Innovativeness in the Domain of Information Technology, Information Systems Research, 9, 2, pp. 204-215, (1998); Kato, Asuka, Reliability and validity of the Japanese version of the Self-Stigma Scale in patients with type 2 diabetes, Health and Quality of Life Outcomes, 12, 1, (2014); Brazilian Central Bank, (2018); Bae, Kee Hong, Creditor rights, enforcement, and bank loans, Journal of Finance, 64, 2, pp. 823-860, (2009); Relatorio De Estabilidade Financeira, (2017); Boerema, Anke M., Psychometric properties of the Dutch Depression Stigma Scale (DSS) and associations with personal and perceived stigma in a depressed and community sample, PLOS ONE, 11, 8, (2016); Bolander, Willy, Social networks within sales organizations: Their development and importance for salesperson performance, Journal of Marketing, 79, 6, pp. 1-16, (2015); Liao, Chechen, Factors influencing internet banking adoption, Social Behavior and Personality, 44, 9, pp. 1443-1455, (2016); Chen, Deqiu, Social Trust and Bank Loan Financing: Evidence from China, Abacus, 52, 3, pp. 374-403, (2016); Modern Methods for Business Research, (1998)","L.H.

The recent proliferation of the mobile payment sector led by innovative mobile Fintech payment services such as Apple Pay and Samsung Pay is the most important and fastest growing Fintech services from consumers’ perspective. Although businesses have been making efforts to spread the use of the services, security is crucial in the diffusion of the services. Despite the importance, the role of perceived security in continuous intention to use mobile, Fintech services has not yet been investigated in depth. Thus, this study investigates the relationships between perceived security, knowledge regarding the services, confirmation, perceived usefulness, and satisfaction. We propose a research model using an extended post-acceptance model (EPAM) as a theoretical framework in the context of Fintech services. We then validate the model using the data collected from the service users. The analyzed results show that knowledge and perceived security in mobile Fintech services have a significant influence on users’ confirmation and perceived usefulness. However, perceived security does not directly influence users’ satisfaction and continual intention to use. We further find significant relationships among confirmation, perceived usefulness, satisfaction, and continual intention to use of the services.

Several observations are noteworthy. First, mobile money facilitated by mobile technology stands out as the most successful innovation in extending financial inclusion in Africa. Second, the most promising innovation that has the potential to alleviate SME funding constraints is crowdfunding. However, this potential can only be realized by increasing internet access in Africa, the region with the lowest penetration.

Banks have always made use of new technologies to deliver banking products in more effective ways. This process continues today. Technological change not only results in more risk such as cyberattacks and money laundering, but also opens up new opportunities for banks and their customers. Banks have adapted their business models accordingly. They partner with FinTech to develop and deliver new technologies. Regulators and supervisors change as well, moving gradually in the FinTech space, helping them to develop their activities and starting to regulate their services. So even though FinTech and digital can be disruptive indeed — both for banks and regulators — they also create a new cross border ecosystem whereby banks and tech companies interact and compete, while regulators and supervisors adapt their oversight, leading to better financial services for customers and higher added value for society, provided that a level playing field is ensured. © Henry Stewart Publications.","Customer experience; Cyber resilience; Digital; Ecosystem; FinTech; Innovation; Regulation; Supervision; Technology","","","","","","","","Implications of Fintech Developments for Banks and Supervisors; undefined; Nasdaq Defines High Definition Trading as Computerised Trading Using Proprietary Algorithms It is Estimated that 50 Per Cent of Stock Trading Volume in the Usa is Currently Being Driven by Computer Backed High Frequency Trading also Known as Algo or Algorithmic Trading; As Much Less Staff is Needed Robo Advice can Be Given at A Much Lower Cost for A Much Larger Group of Clients with Less Restrictions on the Minimum Amount to Invest; undefined; Applying to the Regulatory Sandbox, (2017); Regulatory Sandbox Cohort, (2018); Regulatory Sandbox Lessons Learned Report, (2017); Global Financial Innovation Network Gfin Consultation Document, (2018); Noting A Number of Standards Setting Committees and Similar Organisations Active in Payments System Policy Matters in Which the Federal Reserve Participates, (2017)","H.

The financial sector has changed from a traditional one marked by conventional financial intermediation structures towards an increasingly technology-affected one. Not only this change but anticipated developments too require if not extensively reconsidering the design of financial regulation,1 then at least not turning a blind eye to shaping developments.

Recent advances in cryptography, data analytics, and machine learning are visibly ""disrupting"" traditional methods of delivering financial services and conducting financial transactions. Less visibly, fintech is also changing the way we think about finance: it is gradually recasting our collective understanding of the financial system in normatively neutral terms of applied information science. By making financial transactions easier, faster, and cheaper, fintech seems to promise a micro-level ""win-win "" solution to the financial system's many ills. This Article challenges such narratives and presents an alternative account of fintech as a systemic, macro-level phenomenon. Grounding the analysis of evolving fintech trends in a broader institutional context, the Article Exposes the normative and political significance of fintech as the catalyst for a potentially decisive shift in the underlying public-private balance of powers, competencies, and roles in the financial system. In developing this argument, the Article makes three principal scholarly contributions. First, it introduces the concept of the New Deal settlement in finance: a fundamental political arrangement, in force for nearly a century, pursuant to which profit-seeking private actors retain control over allocating capital and generating financial risks,1 while the sovereign public bears responsibility for maintaining systemic financial stability. Second, the Article advances a novel conceptual framework for understanding the deep-seated dynamics that have eroded the New Deal settlement in recent decades. It offers a taxonomy of core mechanisms that both (a) enable private actors to continuously synthesize tradable financial assets and scale up trading activities, and (b) undermine the public's ability to manage the resulting system-wide risks. Finally, the Article shows how and why specific fintech applications-cryptocurrencies, distributed ledger technologies, digital crowdfunding, and robo-advising-are poised to amplify the effect of these destabilizing mechanisms, and thus potentially exacerbate the tensions and imbalances in today's financial markets and the broader economy. It is this potential that renders fintech a public policy challenge of the highest order. © 2019 Yale Journal on Regulation.

Each service has a different representation in a different platform even though targeting the same business objectives. This situation results in the problem of re-developing similar set of requirements for different devices and services which in turn results in multiplied effort in software development and degradation in the software quality because of the replicated code. The objective of this paper is to present a device independent user interface development approach that eliminates the replicated user interface development effort of the same set of services for different platforms/devices while increasing the presentation performance. In this context, we provide a basic technique that uses a json based user interface definition format, called omni-script, to separate the representation of banking services in different platforms/devices, so called channels. Omni-script is a pioneering solution being used in a real development environment in banking software domain that is experiencing a shift towards omni-channel user experience, where users are able to seamlessly continue using banking services in different platforms and devices. As the evaluation method, we have measured the actual development effort on a representative sample development team and a set of services. Additionally, we later deployed and measured the rendering time and the amount of data communication for the proposed approach in a real production environment. Production deployment resulted in a remarkable decrease in data communication and in loading times at the client side. As importantly, the proposed approach also resulted in a nearly 75% decrease in service development time by enabling analysts to produce user interface prototypes that can be integrated to service development with minimal effort. © 2019","Multimodal user interface definition; Omni-channel banking services; Omni-channel user experience","Computer software selection and evaluation; Convolutional codes; Software design; Banking services; Development environment; Multimodal user interface; Production environments; Representative sample; User experience; User interface development; User interface prototypes; User interfaces","","","","","(3160205)","This paper is produced from a project supported by The Scientific and Technological Research Counsel of Turkey(TUBITAK) Innovation Funding Programmes Directorate (TEYDEB) under grant number 3160205.","Alt, Rainer, FinTech and the transformation of the financial industry, Electronic Markets, 28, 3, pp. 235-243, (2018); Kotarba, Marcin, New factors inducing changes in the retail banking customer relationship management (CRM) and their exploration by the FinTech industry, Foundations of Management, 8, 1, pp. 69-78, (2016); Dumas, Bruno, Multimodal interfaces: A survey of principles, models and frameworks, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 5440 LNCS, pp. 3-26, (2009); Turk, Matthew A., Multimodal interaction: A review, Pattern Recognition Letters, 36, 1, pp. 189-195, (2014); Distributed User Interfaces, (2011); Omojokun, Olufisayo A., Automatic generation of device user-interfaces?, pp. 251-261, (2007); Yigitbas, Enes, Engineering context-adaptive UIS for task-continuous cross-channel applications, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 9856 LNCS, pp. 281-300, (2016); Reeves, Leah M., Guidelines for multimodal user interface design, Communications of the ACM, 47, 1, pp. 57-59, (2004); Oviatt, Sharon L., Designing the user interface for multimodal speech and pen-based gesture applications: State-of-the-art systems and future research directions, Human-Computer Interaction, 15, 4, pp. 263-322, (2000); W3c Workshop on Multimodal Interaction, (2004)","T.

We compare the Payment Application Data Security Standard’s (PA-DSS) applicability towards transaction-supported blockchain platforms to test the standard’s applicability. By highlighting the differences in implementation on traditional and decentralized transaction platforms, we critique and adapt the standards to fit the decentralized model. In two case studies, we analyze the QTUM and Ethereum blockchain platforms’ industry compliance, as their payment platforms support transactions equivalent to that of applications governed by the PA-DSS. We determine QTUM’s and Ethereum’s capabilities to properly ensure secure data handling with respect to current security standards. After adapting the PA-DSS and analyzing the QTUM and Ethereum platforms, we revise the new set of standards to create a set of best-practices for ensuring data security on both traditional and blockchain payment systems. We report the security gaps identified on each platform based on the final revision of the standards, presenting a conclusive perspective that neither platform is suitable for business adoption based on the PA-DSS standard’s results.

In this practitioner note, the K-means clustering algorithm and LRFMP model are combined in the customer segmentation process. After initial clustering, for a better understanding of valuable customers, additional clustering is implemented in segments that needed further investigation. This approach contributes to a better interpretation of different customer segments. Customer segments, consisting of 23524 business customers are analysed based on their characteristics and appropriate strategies are recommended accordingly. The first stage clustering result shows that customers are best segmented into four groups. The first and fourth segments are clustered again and the final 11 groups of customers are determined.

Even as FinTech seems to redefine the service quality and product delivery through innovative use of technology in design and delivery of financial products and services, there is a need to moderate the hype by introducing a robust regulatory framework to strike a balance between innovation and compliance and to ensure a service orientation over and above the pure commercial instinct.

By examining the growing role of fintech firms in the recent mergers and acquisitions from an investor point of view, this paper contributes to the existing literature by investigating the post-acquisition performance of the acquirer firms measured by abnormal returns. We discovered significant positive average abnormal return after acquisition of fintech companies in the short-term and negative average abnormal return in the long-term using event study methodology. The specifics of cross-border acquisitions, the level of the domestic market development of the acquirer, and other characteristics of M&A deals are considered in order to explain the reaction of investors to announcements of fintech firms’ acquisitions.

Under the background of financial technology (Fintech), how to select an appropriate technology company to cooperate for the banks has become a key. The technology company selection can be regarded as a kind of multi-attribute group decision making (MAGDM) problems. The probabilistic linguistic term set (PLTS) is a useful tool to express decision makers’ (DMs’) evaluations in the technology company selection. This paper develops a new method for MAGDM with PLTSs. Firstly, the possibility degree and range value of PLTSs are defined. Then a possibility degree algorithm is designed for ranking PLTSs. An Euclidean distance measure between PLTSs is presented and extended to probabilistic linguistic matrices. Based on Archimedean t-norm and s-norm, some new operational laws for PLTSs are defined and some desirable properties are discussed. Then, a generalized probabilistic linguistic Hamacher weighted averaging (GPLHWA) operator and a generalized probabilistic linguistic Hamacher ordered weighted averaging (GPLHOWA) operator are developed. Some useful properties for these operators are investigated in detail. Combined with the subjective weights of DMs, the DMs’ weights are determined by the adjusted coefficients. Using the GPLHWA operator, the collective decision matrix is obtained by aggregating all the individual decision matrices. By maximizing the total weighted square possibility degree, a multi-objective program is constructed to derive the attribute weights.

They are the biggest job creators and offer a path to the American Dream. But for many, it is difficult to get the capital they need to operate and succeed. In the Great Recession, access to capital for small businesses froze, and in the aftermath, many community banks shuttered their doors and other lenders that had weathered the storm turned to more profitable avenues. For years after the financial crisis, the outlook for many small businesses was bleak. But then a new dawn of financial technology, or “fintech,” emerged. Beginning in 2010, new fintech entrepreneurs recognized the gaps in the small business lending market and revolutionized the customer experience for small business owners. Instead of Xeroxing a pile of paperwork and waiting weeks for an answer, small businesses filled out applications online and heard back within hours, sometimes even minutes. Banks scrambled to catch up. Technology companies like Amazon, PayPal, and Square entered the market, and new possibilities for even more transformative products and services began to appear. In Fintech, Small Business and the American Dream, former U.S. Small Business Administrator and Senior Fellow at Harvard Business School, Karen G. Mills, focuses on the needs of small businesses for capital and how technology will transform the small business lending market. This is a market that has been plagued by frictions: it is hard for a lender to figure out which small businesses are creditworthy, and borrowers often don’t know how much money or what kind of loan they need. New streams of data have the power to illuminate the opaque nature of a small business’s finances, making it easier for them to weather bumpy cash flows and providing more transparency to potential lenders. Mills charts how fintech has changed and will continue to change small business lending, and how financial innovation and wise regulation can restore a path to the American Dream. An ambitious book grappling with the broad significance of small business to the economy, the historical role of credit markets, the dynamics of innovation cycles, and the policy implications for regulation, Fintech, Small Business and the American Dream is relevant to bankers, fintech investors, and regulators; in fact, to anyone who is interested in the future of small business in America. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.","banking; emerging markets; Financial technology; FinTech; small business banking; small business borrowers; small business lenders","","","","","","","","Gallup, (2018); Brookings Papers Microeconomics, (1993); Theory of Economic Development, (1934); Democracy Journal, (2011); Glaeser, Edward L., Entrepreneurship and urban growth: An empirical assessment with historical mines, Review of Economics and Statistics, 97, 2, pp. 498-520, (2015); Craig, Ben R., Small firm finance, credit rationing, and the impact of SBA-guaranteed lending on local economic growth, Journal of Small Business Management, 45, 1, pp. 116-132, (2007); Gift of Global Talent how Migration Shapes Business Economy Society, (2018); Richmond Times Dispatch, (2009); Haltiwanger, John C., Who creates jobs?

First, it is argued that the question that preoccupies ‘coherentists’ (concerning the application of the law of contract to smart contracts, and the fit between smart contracts and the paradigmatic ‘fiat contracts’ that are recognised by the law of contract) is neither as puzzling nor as important as might be supposed. Secondly, it is argued that, if there are concerns about the acceptability of smart contracts, then the conversation that needs to be had is of a ‘regulatory-instrumentalist’ nature; in particular, if the question is one of public policy restrictions on the use of smart contracts, then the appropriate balance of interests needs to be made by an institution that has both the necessary mandate and the appropriate mind-set. Thirdly, it is argued that there are conversations that we currently do not have but which urgently need to be had. Blockchain is a potentially transformative technology and it is important to have more fundamental conversations about the kind of community that we want to be. © 2019, The Author(s).","Blockchain; Coherentism; Contract law; Regulatory-instrumentalism; Smart contracts; Technological management","","","","","","","","Understanding Contract Law, (2007); Mlr, (1997); Hastings Science and Technology Law Journal, (2017); Human Dignity in Bioethics and Biolaw, (2001); Brincker, Maria, Privacy in public and the contextual conditions of agency, pp. 64-90, (2017); Brownsword, Roger, Code, control, and choice: Why East is East and West is West, Legal Studies, 25, 1, pp. 1-21, (2005); Brownsword, Roger, Rights, Regulation, and the Technological Revolution, pp. 1-336, (2009); Brownsword, Roger, Contract in a networked world, pp. 116-145, (2010); Brownsword, Roger, Whither the Law and the Law Books?

A long-term orientation of relationship banking streamlines incentives and supports the long-term needs of bank customers. However, banks might be lured into transaction banking due to the presence of IT-driven economies of scale and competition from FinTech start-ups and IT companies. In this light, the article evaluates the role of distances, artificial intelligence, and behavioral biases. Implications for stability in banking are explored.

Few scholars have studied the influence mechanism behind the adoption of Fintech services. This paper proposes an improved technology acceptance model (TAM) that incorporates user innovativeness, government support, brand image, and perceived risk as determinants of trust to investigate how users adopt Fintech services. We designed a questionnaire, sent it to active customers of the Hefei Science and Technology Rural Commercial Bank, and obtained 387 eligible responses. We analyzed the data with a structural equation model (SEM) to test the hypotheses, including the relationships of all latent variables. The results reveal that users' trust in Fintech services has a very significant influence on users' attitudes for adoption. In addition, perceived ease of use and perceived risk does not affect users' attitudes toward the adoption regarding Fintech services. This study contributes to the literature of the adoption of Fintech services by providing a more comprehensive view of the determinants of users' attitudes by combining trust of Fintech services with TAM. © 2019 by the authors.","Adoption; Fintech services; Technology acceptance model","","","","","","(16030801121, 17030801001); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71472001, 71571058, 71690235, 91846107); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","Funding text 1: Funding: This work is fully supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Nos. 91846107, 71571058, 71690235 and 71472001], and Anhui Provincial Science and Technology Major Project [Nos. 16030801121 and 17030801001]. and Key Project of Humanities and Social Sciences in Colleges and Universities of Anhui Province under Grant No. SK2017A0443.; Funding text 2: Acknowledgments: This work is fully supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Nos. 91846107, 71571058, 71690235 and 71472001], and Anhui Provincial Science and Technology Major Project [Nos. 16030801121 and 17030801001], and Key Project of Humanities and Social Sciences in Colleges and Universities of Anhui Province under Grant No. SK2017A0443.","Gabor, Daniela Veronica, The digital revolution in financial inclusion: international development in the fintech era, New Political Economy, 22, 4, pp. 423-436, (2017); Leong, Carmen, Nurturing a FinTech ecosystem: The case of a youth microloan startup in China, International Journal of Information Management, 37, 2, pp. 92-97, (2017); Alt, Rainer, FinTech and the transformation of the financial industry, Electronic Markets, 28, 3, pp. 235-243, (2018); Zavolokina, Liudmila, The FinTech phenomenon: antecedents of financial innovation perceived by the popular press, Financial Innovation, 2, 1, (2016); IEEE Trans Veh Technol, (2025); Priem, Richard L., Insights and new directions from demand-side approaches to technology innovation, entrepreneurship, and strategic management research, Journal of Management, 38, 1, pp. 346-374, (2012); Priem, Richard L., A Demand-side Perspective on Supply Chain Management, Journal of Supply Chain Management, 48, 2, pp. 7-13, (2012); Financial Development Institutions Growth and Poverty Reduction, (2008); Nakashima, Tokushi, Creating credit by making use of mobility with FinTech and IoT, IATSS Research, 42, 2, pp. 61-66, (2018); Gai, Keke, A survey on FinTech, Journal of Network and Computer Applications, 103, pp. 262-273, (2018)","S.

The study also conducted an intensive examination of their arguments by using a core-periphery approach of social representations. This study found that while the three beholders had a common opinion on deregulation of the fintech industry, each of them had different knowledge of the phenomenon.

The improvement priorities, ranked from highest to lowest, are new business partners, new service concepts, organizational innovation, technological innovation, new customer interactions, and new revenue models.

Because it is a new phenomenon, there are few studies on blockchain, and those studies have focused mainly on the technology's potential impacts, whereas how to effectively implement it in an organization remains unknown. Our study intends to fill that gap. Using affordance-actualization (A-A) theory as the theoretical lens, we conducted a case study of blockchain implementation in an organization that has effectively implemented it. We identify three affordances of blockchain in the organization and a process model whereby these affordances are actualized. The process model extends A-A theory by adding an experimentation phase where blockchain's use cases within the organization are identified, developed and tested through conceptual adaptation and constraint mitigation. Our study makes important theoretical contributions to the literature on A-A theory, blockchain, information technology (IT) implementation, and strategic information systems (SIS). Our study can also help IT practitioners to implement blockchain effectively and extract value from their investment. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Actualization; Blockchain; Case study; Experimentation; FinTech; Organizational affordances","Information systems; Actualization; Affordances; Experimentation; FinTech; Information technology implementations; Potential impacts; Strategic impacts; Strategic information systems; Blockchain","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71402186, 71402187); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Joint Research Fund for Overseas Chinese Scholars and Scholars in Hong Kong and Macao, (71529001); Joint Research Fund for Overseas Chinese Scholars and Scholars in Hong Kong and Macao","Funding text 1: Funding for this research was provided by China's NSFC Joint Research Fund for Overseas Chinese Scholars and Scholars in Hong Kong and Macao (71529001), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71402187, 71402186).; Funding text 2: Funding for this research was provided by China’s NSFC Joint Research Fund for Overseas Chinese Scholars and Scholars in Hong Kong and Macao ( 71529001 ), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 71402187 , 71402186 ).","Abraham, Chon, From cacophony to harmony: A case study about the IS implementation process as an opportunity for organizational transformation at Sentara Healthcare, Journal of Strategic Information Systems, 20, 2, pp. 177-197, (2011); Andriopoulos, Constantine, Exploitation-exploration tensions and organizational ambidexterity: Managing paradoxes of innovation, Organization Science, 20, 4, pp. 696-717, (2009); Beck, Roman, Blockchain Technology in Business and Information Systems Research, Business and Information Systems Engineering, 59, 6, pp. 381-384, (2017); Beck, Roman, Blockchain - The gateway to trust-free cryptographic transactions, (2016); Benthaus, Janek, Social media management strategies for organizational impression management and their effect on public perception, Journal of Strategic Information Systems, 25, 2, pp. 127-139, (2016); Vom Brocke, Jan, Green information systems: Directives for the IS discipline, Communications of the Association for Information Systems, 33, 1, pp. 509-520, (2013); Burton-Jones, Andrew, How can we develop contextualized theories of effective use?

The FinTech industry employs a technology-based business model to provide financial services, including lending, payment, investment, and financing services. The study is motivated by endogenous growth theory, which seeks to explain technology as the most important driver of economic growth. The study finds that FinTech startups are positively correlated with Indonesia’s economic growth. FinTech firms in their first year are found to be disruptive, but they fail to have serious consequences on Indonesia’s economic growth; however, they seem to significantly encourage economic growth in their second year. These findings are derived after accounting for other important growth determinants, namely, capital per labor, foreign direct investment (FDI), stock market development, and trade openness. © 2019 Bank Indonesia Institute.

This analysis highlights that the effects of HFT on market liquidity, trading strategies and speed, implications for market structure changes, and the relationship between the “scriptability” of corporate disclosure and HFT short-term information advantage, are key themes. The analysis also suggests that many open questions remain unanswered including more recent HFT trading strategies and complex techniques applied to analyse the content of both voluntary and mandatory corporate disclosure. As capital markets evolve, HFT’s speed may no longer be sufficient to maintain competitiveness.

Arguably, the agriculture financing growth has stalled due to many reasons, while Islamic finance has the potential to spur the growth of agriculture financing to promote global food security. Meanwhile, agriculture in Indonesia is still nowhere to its potential. It is hindered by an inefficient and underdeveloped downstream segment, low access to financial and technology. This is a huge opportunity for Islamic finance in helping to bridge the gap through value chain financing approach as one of the strategies to reduce risk and provide socio-economic spillover effect along the chain. Islamic finance could promote agricultures sustainability and a more efficient process with FinTech enabled platform. The multiple case studies propose a sharia compliant community-based financing model in agricultural value chain practice with FinTech enabled platform.

Waqf has played a role of social finance including earlier eras in the history of Islam. With the rapid progress of ICT and growing population of personal communication devices such as cell phones, smartphones, and computers, cash waqf will create huge social value when it is enhanced with ICT, which the author calls “FinTech-enabled cash waqf.” This is not just a conceptual dream, but it is becoming a reality. This paper also proposes possible expanded forms of FinTech-enabled cash waqf, including microfinance, as socially valuable financial systems. Required legal treatments and other necessary conditions are discussed as well from a practical point of view, including the purpose of being a reference for policy makers and social venture entrepreneurs. Academic considerations of the FinTech-enabled cash waqf are also argued, especially regarding a typical criticism against the current practice of Islamic finance from theory-based academic scholars. This process identifies the academic and religious significance of the FinTech-enabled cash waqf, not just as a social form of financial transactions. In the last section, the paper concludes that the FinTech-enabled cash waqf can contribute to socio-economic development in an Islamic community. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","","","","","","","","","Waqf Based Microfinance Realizing the Social Role of Islamic Finance, (2007); Ahmed, Habib, MAQĀṢID AL-SHARĪʿAH AND ISLAMIC FINANCIAL PRODUCTS: A FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSMENT, ISRA International Journal of Islamic Finance, 3, 1, pp. 149-160, (2011); undefined; undefined; Objectives of the Islamic Order, (1979); Chapra, M.

The data are analyzed by the Structural Equation Model (SEM) using Smart PLS V2.0. The researchers use a questionnaire in Google Form to collect the data. It is distributed online with the snowball data collection technique. As a result, 548 respondents are successfully gathered. The results indicate that the factor of users trusts influences perceived usefulness in the adoption to use FinTech services. However, the risk factor does not affect the use of FinTech services, which further does not influence the users’ attitude.

However, research on mechanisms, by which financial technology affects customer intention to use financial processes, is very fragmented. Thus, relying on process virtualization theory, we study the effect of financial technology implementation on intention to use via relationship, synchronism, and identification and control readiness of processes. The results of our conjoint experiment with 302 participants indicate that relationship, synchronism, and identification and control readiness jointly transmit the effect of financial technology implementation on customer intention to use financial processes. Our results further suggest that financial technology implementation generally increases customer intention to use financial processes. Our study integrates research on financial technology and process virtualization by explaining customer intention to use processes with financial technology through process readiness, and supports practitioners in addressing the needs of financial services customers. © 40th International Conference on Information Systems, ICIS 2019.

Consequently, many people are interested to make credit. There are more than 900 alleged violations of law and human rights by online funding applications, including alleged violations of the privacy rights of the debtor’s personal data where billing is submitted not only to the debtor but also to all telephone contacts stored on the debtor’s cellphone without consent. This study is a prescriptive normative study through library research to look for secondary data by using primary, secondary, and tertiary legal materials and field researches. The study reveals several results. Firstly, although the Regulation of the Financial Services Authority Number 77 of 2016 has been published, fintech providers registered in the Financial Services Authority have not upheld a legal culture to protect debtors on the use of debtors’ personal data. Secondly, fintech lending makes it easier for Indonesian people to have a positive impact due to the speed of the application fund disbursement system but this convenience is not matched by the knowledge of debtors who do not read and pay attention to the contents of electronic contracts. Thirdly, as long as the Personal Data Protection Bill has not been ratified, as a preventive measure, the Financial Services Authority can take some alternative roles, namely Financial Services Authority should be involved in reviewing electronic contracts made by fintech lending and giving feasible recommendations on electronic contracts made by parties and standardize electronic contract contents so that each fintech lending company has the same and clear contract contents set by the Financial Services Authority. © 2019, Padjadjaran University.

It analyzes key players on the FinTech market and the developments in various market segments. Particular attention is paid to an empirical analysis of the privacy statements of 505 German FinTech firms and how they were adapted after the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) entered into effect in May 2018. The analysis also includes 38 expert interviews with relevant stakeholders from supervisory and regulatory authorities, the financial and FinTech industry, leading consulting firms and consumer protection agencies. By adopting this approach, the book identifies key regulatory needs, offers a valuable asset for practitioners and academics alike, and shares intriguing insights for lawyers, economists and everyone interested in FinTech and data privacy. The book brings together two of the most topical research areas of our time: financial technology and data privacy. It is a valuable resource for academics and policy makers alike. Douglas Cumming, DeSantis Distinguished Professor, Florida Atlantic University This volume is groundbreaking in providing a seminal analysis of the thriving financial technology sector and in simultaneously highlighting a potential trade-off in data protection. The book offers important insights for regulation and policy, and will be of interest to practitioners, academics, and regulators alike.

As such ecosystems transform, the basis for being seen as legitimate also changes for all actors. Thus, alliances between actors within financial ecosystems are increasingly formed to help gain, maintain, and repair organizational legitimacy. From interviews with fintech startups in Sweden and with venture capitalist firms investing in fintech startups in Sweden, we explore the intertwined quests for organizational legitimacy in a transforming financial ecosystem. As Swedish fintech startups seek to establish a sense of their legitimacy, simultaneously incumbents seek to maintain and repair their organizational legitimacy. Adopting a legitimacy-based view of strategic alliances, we set out the aspects of organizational legitimacy that incumbents and fintech startups look for in a potential partner and how these aspects meet the legitimacy needs of each partner. We argue that alliances further enhance the organizational legitimacy of both fintech startups and incumbents. © Technology Innovation Management Review 2019.","Financial ecosystems; Fintech startups; Organizational legitimacy; Relational perspective; Strategic alliances","","","","","","Chalmers Tekniska Högskola","This article draws on a research project carried out from January to May 2018 to conclude Master of Science programs at Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden.

Yet the significance of financial technology is informed in turn by locally specific traditions of governance and regulation. This article critically interrogates the rise of Chinese fintech, reconceptualizing it as a process of financialization that is embedded in a Chinese systems-oriented authoritarian governance tradition. On the basis of documentary sources, Chinese-language secondary literature, and fieldwork conducted from 2016-18, it argues that in addition to disrupting existing practices of financial intermediation, the emergence of novel digital credit scoring technologies is enabling new forms of algorithmic governance to be exercised over the process of financialization, which in turn represents an important component in the construction of China’s neo-statist authoritarian capitalism. These findings have broader implications for how we understand the importance of new financial technologies in an era of big data, contributing to contemporary debates in international political economy, economic sociology, and Chinese studies. © The Author(s)","Authoritarian capitalism; China; digital credit scoring; financialization; neo-statism; technology","","","","","","","","2018 Report on the Development of Chinas Online Lending Service Industry Chinese Language, (2018); Aitken, Rob, Performing capital toward a cultural economy of popular and global finance, pp. 1-247, (2007); Aitken, Rob, All data is credit data': Constituting the unbanked, Competition and Change, 21, 4, pp. 274-300, (2017); Ang, Yuenyuen, Autocracy with Chinese characteristics: Beijing's behind-the-scenes reforms, Foreign Affairs, 97, 3, pp. 39-46, (2018); China Development Gateway, (2016); Barton, Dominic, Mapping China's middle class, McKinsey Quarterly, 3, pp. 54-60, (2013); Wired, (2017); Bruff, Ian, The Rise of Authoritarian Neoliberalism, Rethinking Marxism, 26, 1, pp. 113-129, (2014); Within P2p Regulation Dual Responsibility System the Cbrc Assumes Responsibility for Third Party Deposits Chinese Language, (2016); Caixin Global, (2017)","J.

These technologies create market segments which are small initially and have not been targeted by the existing companies. Startups are leveraging these types of innovations and are giving tough fight to the traditional organizations. These organizations need to project themselves as the technology leaders, else there is a constant threat for them to be thrown out of the market by new disruptors. This paper investigates technology used by a startup which has the potential to disrupt existing business models. This paper adopts a case-based approach which is a startup along with specific comparison with those organizations which are still relying on traditional methods. For comparison purpose, Paytm is taken as the subject which is leveraging on digital technologies to break the conventional practices followed by brick and mortar banking system. Analysis is done on how Paytm has grown in an accelerated manner by taking advantage of penetration of financial services in India. Favourable ecosystems in the form of government support and markets available in countries like India has definitely fuelled the growth of Paytm. Research also analyses the funding opportunities which have been tapped by Paytm from giant foreign investors like Alibaba group, SoftBank and Berkshire Hathaway. These disruptors do not rely only on opportunity discovery, but also on opportunity creation. They work on combining discovery and creation to tap wide range of possibilities. For example, Paytm has become a synonym for online money transactions. It is also found that these entrepreneurial innovators make optimum use of available resources for their start-ups to create multiple segments of customers. Paytm is also trying to venture into the field of investment banking and fund management for profitability and sustainability of its business. In conclusion, startups with disruptive technologies can create business models which will contribute towards the overall economic development. © IAMOT 2019.","Banking System; Disruptive Technology; Startups","Banking; Commerce; Online systems; Sustainable development; Banking systems; Case-based approach; Digital technologies; Disruptive technology; Funding opportunities; Government supports; Startups; Types of innovations; Investments","","","","","","","Growth, (2015); International Journal of Computing Business Research, (2012); Iosr Journal of Business and Management; Bvimsrs Journal of Management Research, (2016); International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Science, (2015); International Journal of Innovations in Engineering and Technology Ijiet, (2014); Journal of Internet Banking and Commerce, (2017); International Journal of Business and Management Invention; International Journal of Advance Research Ideas and Innovations in Technology, (2017); Heuristic Analysis of Growth of Paytm","","Jain, K.; Sangle, S.; Gupta, R.; Persis, J.; R., M.","Excel India Publishers","","28th International Conference for the International Association of Management of Technology: Managing Technology for Inclusive and Sustainable Growth, IAMOT 2019","2019-04-07 through 2019-04-11","Mumbai","157381","","9789388237543","","","English","Manag.

The focus of consumer education is on technology as a driver of economic growth. Applying technology in the financial industry, also known as FinTech (Financial Technology), to increase efficiency and effectiveness in work, saves time and improves the reliability of data. The sample for this study consisted of 410 people in Bangkok and its vicinity. The study found that the majority of the respondents were females aged 21–30 years, who had undertaken undergraduate studies as students and had an income of less than 10,000 baht per month. The analysis of customer behavior found that financial transactions were mainly carried out through technology because of the convenience in relation to time, and customers know about the services available through financial technology from bank employees and the recommendations of people around them and friends, respectively. An analysis of the data on the use of financial institutions’ financial services revealed that the problems or obstacles in the transactions related to reliability and the failure system have a high level of importance. The hypothesis testing found that people who use financial technology and have made three transactions or more have greater confidence in the legal protection of financial transactions, reliability, stability and responsiveness. © © 2019 GMP Press and Printing.","Acceptance; Digital economy; Financial Technology","","","","","","","","Electronic Payment Transactions in the Second Quarter of 2017, (2017); Fintech Towards Thailand 4 0 E Jodil, (2017); Factors Affecting the Adoption of Contextual Financial Technology Commercial Bank, (2016); Trust in Using Online Banking Services of Consumers in Bangkok, (2014); Turn Thailand into an Investment, (2017); Year 2017 Digital Chase You the Fast and the Furious, (2017); Oliveira, Tiago André Gonçalves Félix De, Mobile payment: Understanding the determinants of customer adoption and intention to recommend the technology, Computers in Human Behavior, 61, pp. 404-414, (2016); undefined, (2017); What is Fintech, (2017); Factors Leading to Acceptance and Purchase Through Social Commerce Facebook Case Study, (2014)","","","GMP Press & Printing Co.,","","","","","","24146722","","","","English","Rev.

The main method of research is a sociological survey on the level of use of financial technologies in the Republic of Tajikistan. In addition, we used the methods of systematization, generalization and graphical presentation of the data to analyze the results of the survey. The levels of use of financial technologies by men and women were compared; it has been found that they vary significantly. In addition, there is a gap in the understanding and use of financial technologies depending on the place of residence (urban/rural). The expansion of digital financial services can, therefore, identify opportunities for continuation and challenges that need to be addressed in promoting women's financial inclusion and economic empowerment. © 2019 GEA College â€“ Faculty of Entrepreneurship.

Technology offers South African banks the opportunity to address inherent socio-economic imbalances in the economy. However, the potential systemic risk it poses threatens to aggravate the situation if it not properly regulated. This paper uses a non-positivist, qualitative research design - the case study approach - to argue that South African banks have adopted a measured mindset to adopting Fintech because they are fundamentally risk-averse. Structural socio-economic imbalances, legacy systems, and a banking industry that has traditionally been conservative are argued to be the main drivers of this.

The cashless system is not just a necessity but also a need of today’s order. Over the past few years, efforts to drive financial inclusion in India have delivered mixed results. Access to bank accounts has increased dramatically, driven by a strong policy and regulatory push. However, the usage of these accounts and the uptake of formal financial services beyond savings accounts has remained exceptionally difficult. The recent initiatives by the Government around demonetization and the move to cashless transactions will further drive innovation and new entrants into the Indust ry. The amendment s to the banking act clearly demonst rate the Government, RBI and Banking institutions intent to ensure stable growth of the economy by ensuring a healthy BFSI. Building Trust within the industry will be paramount to India’s further growth. Newer technologies pose different challenges to the banks and regulators, with security being a key concern. With cyber-frauds on the rise, the regulators and the bankers would have to come together to ensure control mechanisms are in place. A strong push from the Government of India has given the non-banking population easy access to financial products. Payment organizations have demonstrated the advantages of mobile-led solutions and the traditional banking organizations are now trying to make inroads into rural India by launching innovative mobile-based banking solutions. With support from the government, large technology companies are using new ways of reaching out to the rural masses and educate them about the various financial products, thus ensuring that their hard-earned income is rightly invested. © 2019, Ashwin Anokha Publications and Distributors.

Loan distribution was assessed by net loan to assets while profit was assessed by return on assets. This study employed paired sample t-test to examine if net loans to assets and return on assets received differences before and after financial technology startups emerged. The study reveals that financial technology startups disrupt financial institutions’ business and performance because their total of net loans to assets and total of return on assets decrease.

Initially, few structures were developed to help cater to the attention of the Islamic financial industry players involved in peer-to-peer dealings. The new trend of the technological evolution in the banking and financial sector has proved to be the next challenge in this sector. However, the survival of Islamic fintech will heavily rely on the existing established trust within the sector. The potential collaborations between the established Islamic banks, fintech players and start-ups will certainly unleash the potentials of today’s technologies in the Islamic finance industry. Being in their early stages, Malaysia and its counterparts from the GCC states have the potentials to becoming leaders in the Islamic fintech industry and may work together to develop a necessary framework for Islamic fintech advancement. Peer-to-peer arrangement connects crowdfunding investors with entrepreneurs through more transparency, speed dealings and almost free from complications in the documentation. In view of the fact that mushārakah is becoming more practical under the concept of Islamic peer-to-peer deals, this paper attempts to develop a new peer-to-peer financing which is underlain by the Mushārakah Smart Contract Model. The paper proposes a mushārakah model using Mushārakah Smart Contract in which the investors would be crediting their investments for mushārakah purposes with virtual lenders for specific Sharīʽah compliant businesses and share in the profit, based on an agreed dividend under the mushārakah principles.

The rapid rise of Fintechs has changed the business landscape, challenging the established firms with novel solutions and services. As a result, the established firms are turning to new models of cooperation, replacing the hierarchically managed value chains with ecosystems that are modular and decentralized in their architecture. First, a bibliometric analysis was conducted to present the content and relationships in Fintech research in general. Then, a case study on two of the biggest retail banks in Finland and their innovation relationships in developing Distributed Ledger Technologies and related services was conducted. The results show how established players have established multiple innovation relationships, in different ecosystems as well as between them. These can be seen to demonstrate the emergence of Fintech ecosystems. The study contributes to previous literature by making the linkages explicit, particularly by examining the contextual elements that are crucial enablers or hindering factors in such relationships. © 2019 IEEE Computer Society.

As one of the most regulated sectors in Turkish economy, financial services are far from being ignored. FinTech companies in Turkey have been developing innovative products and services that provide great value for consumers and businesses. Fast pace of development in areas based on electronic services such as e-invoice, e-payments, e-government services, importance of FinTechs have become more apparent with their agility in taking action and offering innovative services. However, as agile as they might be, FinTech companies tend to ignore the regulations which financial institutions are subject to. ""If it works here, it works everywhere"" approach may have a serious downside when it comes to execution stage. From definition of the service to areas of application, to formation of the company and background of the investors, the ever-dictating financial sector regulations change dramatically from one country to another. As in the example of popular payment provider PayPal, failing to keep primary systems domestically may lead to a rejection of license application from BRSA (Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency) [1] Another example of such regulations is the need to do Due Diligence and monitor suspicious customer activity for AML/CTF purposes for some FinTechs in payment industry. Such requirements can be daunting for a technology-oriented point of view, and many of these companies face these facts at a later stage when they try to coexist or collaborate with other financial institutions. As these requirements may alter operational costs, human resources, and even IT infrastructure, they struggle to find investment or sign contracts with financial institutions. This study covers both successful and unsuccessful FinTech projects in payments and their position against regulations and offer remediations for better acceptance within Turkish financial sector. © 2019 The Authors.

In this research, we are aiming to draw a framework by using business experience in Kuveyt Türk Participation Bank in Turkey to give guidance to other financial institutions in Fintech Integration Process. This study contains entire fintech Integration Process from revealing the needs of the internal departments to the completion of fintech integration. We divided Fintech Integration Process into seven phases. First phase, collecting needs of internal departments. Second phase consist of scouting relevant fintechs around the world by using databases and online platforms. Third phase, fintech makes presentation for introduction and explains its business model. At the end of this meeting, relevant bank employees evaluate the presentation and decide whether to invite fintech again for Business Committee or not. Fourth phase, fintech enters Business Committee to make presentation for Vice Presidents of the relevant departments. Fifth phase, fintech meets with IT, compliance and legal departments to discuss and solve problems. In sixth phase, senior management makes decision to start POC (Proof of Concept) process. Lastly, in seventh phase, fintech integration comes alive for the customer use. All these phases are constructed to mitigate risks and increase awareness of fintechs in the departments. In this way, most of the departments get in touch with fintechs and understand the importance of external collaboration. © 2019 The Authors.

India, however, remain at a very low on the index of clean countries in the world. The causes for lack of proper hygienic conditions in India are many like poverty of the people, low level of literacy, cultural & religious customs of different groups etc. Due to the uncleanliness of the places, the Indian public is subjected to many diseases and discomforts. Even after seven decades of attaining independence, the situation has not changed for better. Realizing the importance of cleanliness in the country, the Government of India launched a special initiative called ``Swachha Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Campaign) under the aegis of Ministry of drinking water & sanitation on 2nd October, 2014 commemorating the birth day of the Father of the Nation. The campaign has attracted many stakeholders like State Governments, NGOs, Corporates of Public and Private sectors. The aim is to make India a clean country by 2019. This is the biggest behavioral change initiative taken by the Government in post independent era. ONGC, a Maharatna company and Numero Uno of public sector companies in India has also drawn numerous programmes in line with the mission of ``Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’’. (Clean India Campaign). It has been contributing generously towards the cause of Swachh Bharat through its fund meant for the Corporate Social Responsibility.

V., ","The financial services sector in India is facing a blitzkrieg of financial technologies and applications. Recent innovations in the FinTech sector has disrupted all aspects of finance, ranging from payments, lending, investments to insurance and other service areas. 67% of Indian financial institutions perceive FinTech as a powerful threat to their survival. The FinTech sector has witnessed increased participation from non-financial players such as telecom, power, and other industries. Emerging disruptive trends have proven that a large dataset can be effectively leveraged with total customer engagement and drastically lower investments in IT infrastructure. This paper provides a reflective view of the collective impact of the government digital policies and emerging disruptive technology in India. The paper examines the FinTech disruption formula and its relative implication on the financial services landscape by substituting financial products with IT applications which are cheaper, better and faster. The paper entails the unique case study of ‘India Stack’ aimed at creating a single financial ecosystem in India that is presence-less, paperless and cashless.

Moreover, numerous novel blockchain-enabled financial instruments emerged in recent years expanding global finance ecosystems and the provided services.

More importantly, we inductively develop a Blockchain Fintech Fitness Framework that maps the most suitable blockchain technologies - conceptualized along eight features - to the different categories of financial services offered by FinTechs.

The complex is rapidly evolving, by the end of July 2018 there were about 1700 cryptoprojects globally. The cryptocomplex includes separate cryptosystems linked into a single network via cryptocurrencies trade. The article reveals economic nature and business models of the three largest and most famous cryptosystems – Bitcoin, Ethereum и Ripple, which are responsible for about 70% of the global cryptocomplex capitalization. Though Bitcoin and Ethereum try to create the alternative to the traditional financial system, Ripple proposes new cutting edge technological and effective decisions for the existing banking and payments systems. The authors show that the largest global private cryptosystem Bitcoin, whose goal is substitution of fiat money with bitcoin cryptocurrency, in reality is far away from the ideal system of distributed money, which automatically maintains deals between peers via the neutral computer code. Bitcoin, as well as other systems of cryptocurrencies, has inherent hierarchy and vivid monopoly effects. De-facto control over the Bitcoin functioning rests with the largest players, who replaced the central bank. These players are the main beneficiaries of recurrent rise in capitalization of cryptocurrencies. The strategic task of making bitcoin an alternative to fiat money as a mean of payments has failed. Due to the excessive price volatility bitcoin failed to become a worthy alternative to fiat money and traditional assets as a mean of saving for broad categories of investors. Ethereum and Ripple business models are weakly linked to the dynamics of cryptocurrencies development, serving these systems. Ethereum business model provides for maximization of incomes, rents and other benefits for the system creators from its extensive development. Ripple made an economic bet on selling its special digital solutions to traditional players in financial markets. The authors make a conclusion that cryptocurrencies effectively serve interests of the two clienteles. First are the pioneers of financial sector digitalization, including computer programmers, computer engineers, cryptography and game theory experts as well as venture investors working in parallel. Second are economic agents engaged into various illegal and criminal activities. The authors forecast that given the policies of financial markets regulators the pseudo anonymity of transactions in the sector of cryptocurrencies will cease to exist in the nearest future. © 2019 Academic Educational Forum on International Relations.

To enable management decision making easier, methodology for identification of possible microeconomic risks and their influence on the current activity and the whole business model of the company has to be shaped accordingly. The aim of this research is to find out what and how microeconomic factors affect business modelling of the FinTech companies. In this research the authors used a continuous comparative analysis method as well as content analysis method [1]. In interviews, experts were asked to assess the significance of specific microeconomic factors by using the Likert’s scale.

The rapid development of the digital economy at the national and worldwide levels in recent decades has accelerated processes of transformation of financial systems and led to financialiation of the global economy. FinTech companies operating in the financial market represent a new, quite special category of parabank institutions. They are characterised by the implementation of modern technologies to develop and provide traditional financial services. It would not be possible to provide such services without the Internet and digitalisation, compatibility of electronic devices, including hardware and software, nor would it become possible without new experiences, skills and consumer confidence. This is a kind of analogy with search engines that have changed the architecture of the market and mediation and led to the transformation of business models of financial market entities, in particular banks. Purpose. This paper presents the results of the possibility of providing financial services without banks. It determines the main aspects of competition and directions of combining FinTech and banking. Methods. In evaluation the FinTech and banking sectors, the authors have used statistical monitoring, as well as dynamic, comparative and structural analysis. Results. The results of the study show that FinTech allows creating new services that are not provided by traditional financial intermediaries. It has been proven that the limits for FinTech companies to avoid banking rules and regulations are expanding, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to prove that this is happening beyond the law or outside the law. An analysis of the global trends in the development of the FinTech industry has shown that the volume of investments in this area in 2018 was USD 111.8 billion, which is almost 6 times more than in 2013. The authors examine the main forms of interaction between banks and FinTech companies. Basic models of banks' participation in the creation of FinTech companies are substantiated. The authors of the article have analysed characteristics of the largest FinTech accelerators, identified and characterised the main risks and opportunities relating to FinTech for the banking and consumer sectors. Conclusions. The presented paper reveals the modern trends in FinTech development. They should be taken into account in defining the key determinants of the transformation of the banking sector in relation to the formation of new business models of banks with regard to the challenges of digitalisation. © 2019 Institute of Society Transformation.","Bank; Banking; Financial market; Financial services; FinTech accelerators; FinTech company; Innovative financial technologies","","","","","","","","Jagtiani, Julapa A., Do fintech lenders penetrate areas that are underserved by traditional banks?, Journal of Economics and Business, 100, pp. 43-54, (2018); Microelectronics Revolution, (1980); Rise of the Network Society, (1996); Digital Economy Promise and Peril in the Age of Networked Intelligence, (1996); Being Digital, (1995); Measuring of the Digital Economy, (2001); Mediterranean Journal of Social Sciences, (2015); How the Digital Economy is Changing Corporate Pricing and Inflation, (2017); Lerner, Josh, The consequences of financial innovation: A counterfactual research agenda, Annual Review of Financial Economics, 3, pp. 41-85, (2011); Levine, Ross L., Bank-based or market-based financial systems: Which is better?, Journal of Financial Intermediation, 11, 4, pp. 398-428, (2002)","","","Institute of Society Transformation os@osp.com.ua","","","","","","17286220","","","","English","Eco.

In doing so, this paper examines Small Town Bank (STB)1, a regional bank in Indonesia, regarding its ability to innovate. Data are obtained from primary sources through internal and external questionnaires, as well as secondary data. The results of the study indicate that, in general, the bank already has a reasonably good innovation readiness, but there are several aspects that need to be noted, namely: Optimization of current services, consolidation, and internal restructuration. Concurrently, while fintech has a very broad and massive technical and managerial impact, it does not mean that incumbent banks and traditional financial services cannot compete. © 2019 Nofie Iman. © 2019 LLC CPC Business Perspectives.

Research design, data, and methodology - The problem of this paper is summarized in the lack of studies in this subject. So, a survey was applied on 400 respondents in Egypt to investigate the impact of fintech on facilitating e-government services, in order to determine which fintech item can affect any of facilitating services dimensions. Results - The results revealed that bank accounts with e-government doesn't affect any of facilitating services dimension, while each of the remain items has an effect on some dimensions and does not has effect on others. Conclusions - Data analysis revealed that the most obstacles that face respondents resulted in the weakness of internet networks, lack of efficient employees in e-government portal and lack of system effectiveness. In general, it clears that fintech implementation affect the dimensions of facilitating e-government services, however not all fintech implementation components have the same effect on the dimensions. © Korean Distribution Science Association (KODISA).","Egyptian e-government; Financial technology; Fintech in e-government; ICT in e-government","","","","","","","","Journal Academic for Social and Human Studies, (2013); Alderete, María Verónica, The mediating role of ICT in the development of open government, Journal of Global Information Technology Management, 21, 3, pp. 172-187, (2018); Almarabeh, Tamara Y., A general framework for E-government: Definition maturity challenges, opportunities, and success, European Journal of Scientific Research, 39, 1, pp. 29-42, (2010); Proceedings of the Iadis International Conference E Commerce, (2006); Bertot, John Carlo, Using ICTs to create a culture of transparency: E-government and social media as openness and anti-corruption tools for societies, Government Information Quarterly, 27, 3, pp. 264-271, (2010); Burtch, Gordon, An empirical examination of the antecedents and consequences of contribution patterns in crowd-funded markets, Information Systems Research, 24, 3, pp. 499-519, (2013); Burtch, Gordon, Cultural differences and geography as determinants of online prosocial lending, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 38, 3, pp. 773-794, (2014); Alliance for Financial Inclusion Afi, (2016); Ebbers, Wolfgang E., Impact of the digital divide on e-government: Expanding from channel choice to channel usage, Government Information Quarterly, 33, 4, pp. 685-692, (2016); Foster, Christopher, Innovation and scaling of ICT for the bottom-of-the-pyramid, Journal of Information Technology, 28, 4, pp. 296-315, (2013)","E.

This circumstance is particularly relevant in the case of the tourism sector, which has been able to adopt and adapt information and communication technologies (ICT) to its processes with greater anticipation. Technological progress and the massive use of information and communication technologies have allowed the optimization of activities carried out by Iraqi companies, be they public, private or of any kind. This advance has increased the use of ICT, particularly in the provision of services, which are trying to solve many and varied problems. Each year researchers talk with tech leaders about the biggest problems they'll face in the near future, where organizations in the current era are facing major challenges due to technological progress and competition on the worldwide web . This requires the use of administrative policies with advanced financial technology to improve strategic performance and competition. This is the purpose of this research, which employed a set of policies and administrative practices using financial technology that have been proven through studies and researches on its effectiveness and how to employ this in improving strategic performance and competition. The research was conducted by sampling 319 respondents within the tourism industry through the use of a structured questionnaire. The results of each respondent's responses were measured using a Likert scale. The results were obtained from the PLS and the structural equation modelling method. The study concluded that these tools required a set of powers to attract financial technology that can contribute to improving strategic performance. © 2019 AJHTL.","E-controlling; E-execution; E-organizing; E-planning; Fintech; PLS","","","","","","","","International Journal of Novel Research in Marketing Management and Economics, (2015); Support Extent Provided by Universities Senior Management in Assisting the Transition to E Management, (2018); Effects of Management Accounting Practices on Firm Performance Antecedent Factors and the Role of Managerial Functions Ahmed Abdullah Saad Al Dhubaibi, (2016); Management, (2015); Androwis, Neven, Total quality management practices and organizational performance in the construction chemicals companies in Jordan, Benchmarking, 25, 8, pp. 3180-3205, (2018); Georgetown Journal of International Law, (2015); Baird, Kevin M., The relationships between organizational culture, total quality management practices and operational performance, International Journal of Operations and Production Management, 31, 7, pp. 789-814, (2011); Strategic Planning for Public and Nonprofit Organizations, (1995); Bulej, Lubomír, Performance awareness in component systems: Vision paper, Proceedings - IEEE Computer Society's International Computer Software and Applications Conference, pp. 514-519, (2012); Modern Methods for Business Research, (1998)","S.M.

FinTechs are companies that combine technological and financial attributes in their business models. In recent years, the rise of FinTech has attracted much attention since they challenge incumbent financial service companies including the traditional banking model. Innovative FinTech Business Models are Bitcoin, Tag Cash, Oradian, Satago, Simple Tax, Transfer wise, Holvi and TRDATA able to become a success because they could reach out to a humungous Global market. However, the growth in FinTech industry has not spurred up only because of small-scale entrepreneurs; the role of major financial industries cannot be neglected in this regard. The entrepreneurs work at small-scale in the FinTech industry. They have the capacity to bear the risk of failure in a better way as compared to the major financial institutions. Financial institutions work entirely on public trust. They are highly regulated by the financial authorities in order to add up to their reliability. These financial institutions are answerable to the public for all their operations and therefore, they have to closely guard their investment choices. © 2019, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

This study determines the level of profitability of companies before and after the emergence of FinTech products. The authors focused on companies that have launched FinTech products and published their financial reports. The study sample consisted of 17 FinTech products from 16 companies in Indonesia. The limited number of the sample was caused by not all of them having published its financial reports, while we have checked 157 FinTech companies. An event study approach using paired sample T-test is utilized. The period used in this study is four years, covering two years before and two years after the company launched FinTech products. Data were obtained from IDX, FinTech.id, and company web-pages. The results clearly showed that there was a significant influence on return on assets (ROA), but no significant difference in return on equity (ROE).

However, applying traditional regulatory strategies to new technological ecosystems has proved conceptually difficult. Part of the challenge lies in managing the trade-offs that accompany the regulation of innovations that could, conceivably, both help and hurt consumers as well as market participants. Problems also arise from the common assumption that today's fintech is a mere continuation of the story of innovation that has shaped finance for centuries. This Article offers a new theoretical framework for understanding and regulating fintech by showing how the supervision of financial innovation is invariably bound by what can be described as a policy trilemma. Specifically, we argue that when seeking to provide clear rules, maintain market integrity, and encourage financial innovation, regulators have long been able to achieve, at best, only two out of these three goals. Moreover, today's innovations exacerbate the trade-offs historically embodied in the trilemma by breaking down financial services supply chains into discrete parts and disintermediating traditional functions using cutting edge, but untested, technologies, thereby introducing unprecedented uncertainty as to their risks and benefits. This Article seeks to catalogue the strategies taken by regulatory authorities to navigate the trilemma, and posits them as operating across a spectrum of interrelated responses. The Article then proposes supplemental administrative tools to support not only market, but also regulatory experimentation and innovation. © 2018, Chris Brummer & Yesha Yadav.","","","","","","","","","Reuters, (2017); New York Times, (2018); Wall St J, (2018); Cryptoassets Legal Regulatory and Monetary Perspectives, (2019); Sec Confirms that Some Initial Coin Offerings are Illegal Unregistered Securities Offerings, (2017); White and Case, (2017); Hearing Before the H Comm on Fin Servs 115th Cong; Wall St J, (2016); undefined, (2017); Am Banker, (2016)","","","Georgetown Law Journal Association gli@law.georgetown.edu","","","","","","00168092","","","","English","Georget.

However, lack of funding and limited distribution channels to reach customers are frequent problems faced by farmers to meet the level of sustainability. Agriculture's sustainability can be strengthened by allowing an innovation of services such as Financial Technology (FinTech), and digital marketplace. Digital marketplace with Fintech enabled might transform agriculture's business process into more sustainable in term of funding and distribution. FinTech offers farmers convenient ways of getting sources of funding through crowdfunding and digital payment system. Thus, digital marketplace can act as a platform for FinTech to integrate the innovative financial solution into broader agriculture's ecosystem. The study proposes a modelling digital marketplace with FinTech enabled especially crowdfunding and payment system in order to support agriculture's sustainability. The model connects all actors (farmers, landowners, investors, and consumers) into a platform that can promote transparency, empowerment, resourcefulness, and public engagement in agriculture. © 2019 The Authors.

Improvement of service quality is the main issue addressed in this taxonomy, and there are a large number of emerging technologies including blockchain-based cryptocurrencies and smart contracts. Due to its innovative nature in accounting, blockchain can also be used in lots of other FinTech contexts where token models play an important role for financial engineering. This paper revisits some of the key concepts accumulated behind this trend, and shows a generalized understanding of the technology using an adapted stochastic process. With a focus on financial instruments using blockchain, research directions toward stable applications are identified with the help of a newly proposed stabilizer: interpretation function of token valuation.

Financial institutions are not unfamiliar with this tendency since they have the need to respond faster to the changes in their business environments. This is partly due to the new generation of financial technology (fintech) companies that have shown a significant difference in time to market and in speeding up software development. To compete with fintech companies, financial institutions are looking for improving their software development processes focusing on applying agile practices in a better way. This article presents a set of proposals to improve software development in the LHV Bank. The set of proposals has been determined through a literature review and interviews conducted in two leading financial institutions and two fintech companies.

The proposed genetic model transmits information to future generations in the network weights rather than the neurons. The innovative genetic algorithm is implanted in a complex deep learning structure that emulates the human brain: Reinforcement Learning takes fast and local decisions, Deep Learning Clusters provide identity and memory, Deep Learning Management Clusters take final strategic decisions and finally Genetic Learning transmits the learned information to future generations. This structure has been applied and validated in Fintech, a Bitcoin Smart Investment application based in an Intelligent Banker that performs Buy and Sell decisions on several Cryptocurrencies with an associated exchange and risk. Our results are promising; we have connected the human brain and genetics with Machine Learning based on the Random Neural Network model where Artificial Intelligence, similar as biology, is learning gradually and continuously while adapting to the environment. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Bitcoin; Deep learning clusters; Fintech; Genetic learning; Random neural network; Reinforcement learning; Smart investment","Brain; Clustering algorithms; Deep learning; Electronic money; Genes; Genetic algorithms; Information management; Investments; Neural networks; Reinforcement learning; Bitcoin; Fintech; Future generations; Genetic learning; Learning managements; Learning structure; Random neural network; Strategic decisions; Learning algorithms","","","","","","","Kirschner, Marc W., The plausibility of life: Resolving Darwin's Dilemma, pp. 1-314, (2005); Department of Molecular Cell Biology Weizmann Institute of Science, (2008); Adaptive Individuals in Evolving Populations, (1996); Bassett, Dani S., Small-world brain networks, Neuroscientist, 12, 6, pp. 512-523, (2006); Sporns, Olaf, Organization, development and function of complex brain networks, Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 8, 9, pp. 418-425, (2004); Leshno, Moshe M., Neural network prediction analysis: The bankruptcy case, Neurocomputing, 10, 2, pp. 125-147, (1996); Chen, Weisen, Using neural networks and data mining techniques for the financial distress prediction model, Expert Systems with Applications, 36, 2 PART 2, pp. 4075-4086, (2009); Kara, Yakup, Predicting direction of stock price index movement using artificial neural networks and support vector machines: The sample of the Istanbul Stock Exchange, Expert Systems with Applications, 38, 5, pp. 5311-5319, (2011); Güreşen, Erkam, Using artificial neural network models in stock market index prediction, Expert Systems with Applications, 38, 8, pp. 10389-10397, (2011); Zhang, Peter G., Artificial neural networks in bankruptcy prediction: general framework and cross-validation analysis, European Journal of Operational Research, 116, 1, pp. 16-32, (1999)","W.

In an environment where a FinTech payment service provider (FPP) covers only the front-end services, delegating the back-end services to an integrated payment service provider (IPP) such as banks and credit card companies, we show that under the IPP liability regime, the IPP invests more in general, while the respective investment depends on the range of the access fee under the FPP liability regime. Specifically, given a sufficiently great loss from accident, if the access fee is in a certain range, the FPP liability regime is superior in terms of antifraud investment. When the FPP makes its indirect revenue from its user base in addition to the revenue from user fees, we can observe greater antifraud investment under both liability regimes, but the overall decrease in fraud probability is higher under the IPP liability regime. Our results suggest that it might be desirable to induce FPP liability regime, which might necessitate regulating the access fee to achieve such an outcome.

It is rarely mentioned in the media. Our research question is ‘Why does European microfinance suffer from a lack of visibility in the press?’ This study looked at news reports and press releases over a 18-month period (2016–2018) to check if European microfinance and its innovations were in the news. The study finds that, indeed, there are a lot of new innovations in finance. But, first, in Europe, the highly talked about fintech innovations are taking place outside of microfinance institutions (MFIs). Second, the innovations that are talked about in microfinance are taking place in developing countries out of Europe. The study followed this up by examining websites of some of the leading European fintech firms to see what they were doing that made them so visible. We share some best practices in the use of digital technologies by highly innovative fintech firms in areas that could be of use to MFIs in diverse sectors such as mobile payments, credit scoring, card readers, ATMs and management information systems. To become visible, European microfinance may need to demonstrate that it is doing new things and that it is using innovative technologies that helps it reduce costs, increase outreach and, thus, have an impact. Forii such as the European Microfinance Network and the European Microfinance Platform need to promote these innovations by offering appropriate awards. Finally, collaborating with training and educational institutes may help add to visibility. © 2018 Fortune Institute of International Business.","credit scoring; crowdfunding; digital; financial inclusion; Fintech; microfinance","","","","","","","","Abate, Gashaw Tadesse, Rural Finance and Agricultural Technology Adoption in Ethiopia: Does the Institutional Design of Lending Organizations Matter?, World Development, 84, pp. 235-253, (2016); Alam, GM Monirul, Influence of institutional access and social capital on adaptation decision: Empirical evidence from hazard-prone rural households in Bangladesh, Ecological Economics, 130, pp. 243-251, (2016); Ashta, Arvind, Evolution of Mobile Banking Regulations: A Case Study on Legislator's Behavior, Strategic Change, 26, 1, pp. 3-20, (2017); Advanced Technologies for Microfinance Solutions and Challenges, (2011); Management Information Systems for Microfinance Catalyzing Social Innovation for Competitive Advantage, (2015); Ashta, Arvind, FinTech evolution: Strategic value management issues in a fast changing industry, Strategic Change, 27, 4, pp. 301-311, (2018); Good Governance and Growth in Global Economy, (2017); Decision 03040941, (2007); Behl, Abhishek, Analysing the Barriers towards Sustainable Financial Inclusion using Mobile Banking in Rural India, Indian Journal of Science and Technology, 9, 15, (2016); Behl, Abhishek, Enablers and barriers of mobile banking opportunities in rural India: A strategic analysis, International Journal of Business Excellence, 10, 2, pp. 209-239, (2016)","A.

This study provides insight into the structure of the FinTech ecosystem using data-driven visualizations of 6,493 global companies across 24 market segments. We focus on two types of ecosystem entities, namely, (1) firms that create, offer, and acquire FinTech services and (2) investors that fund and enable them. Our analyses reveal a highly skewed global footprint of FinTech activities, differential growth patterns across ecosystem segments, highly interdependent network structure, and a variegated nature of investments and acquisitions led by key incumbents and venture capital firms.

Especially, because of rapidly growing online market and supply of mobile devices, the need for mobile Fintech payment service that enables easy online and off-line payment has increased. According to the 2013 report by market research company Gartner, purchase related global mobile payment market size was predicted to grow from $45.1 billion in 2012 to $224.3 billion in 2017 with average annual growth of 38%. The study will surveyed the recent trends of mobile Fintech payment services and categorized them based on the service forms to suggest requirements and security challenges so that better and securer service can be provided in the future. First, the study defined existing payment services and Fintech payment services by comparing them, and analyzed recent mobile Fintech payment services to classify mobile Fintech payment service providers into Hardware makers, Operating System makers, payment platform providers, and financial institutions to show their common features. Finally it defined requirements that mobile Fintech payment services must meet and security challenges that future and present mobile Fintech payment services will encounter in the perspective of mutual authentication, authorization, integrity, privacy, and availability. Through the suggested study, it is expected that mobile Fintech payment services will develop into more secure services in the future. © 2018, The Author(s).","Finance technology; Fintech; Mobile payment; Security challenges","Authentication; Electronic money; Global system for mobile communications; Mobile telecommunication systems; Average annual growth; Financial institution; Market researches; Mobile payment; Mobile payment market; Mutual authentication; Offline payments; Security challenges; Fintech","","","","","","This work was financially supported by Baewha Women’s University.","Journal of the Korea Institute of Information Security Cryptology, (2016); Park, Sung-wook, Anonymous authentication scheme based on NTRU for the protection of payment information in NFC Mobile environment, Journal of Information Processing Systems, 9, 3, pp. 461-476, (2013); Thakur, Rakhi, Adoption readiness, personal innovativeness, perceived risk and usage intention across customer groups for mobile payment services in India, Internet Research, 24, 3, pp. 369-392, (2014); Dahlberg, Tomi, A critical review of mobile payment research, Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 14, 5, pp. 265-284, (2015); Liébana-Cabanillas, F.

We study how two forces, regulatory differences and technological advantages, contributed to this growth. Difference in difference tests exploiting geographical heterogeneity induced by four specific increases in regulatory burden–capital requirements, mortgage servicing rights, mortgage-related lawsuits, and the movement of supervision to Office of Comptroller and Currency following closure of the Office of Thrift Supervision–all reveal that traditional banks contracted in markets where they faced more regulatory constraints; shadow banks partially filled these gaps. Relative to other shadow banks, fintech lenders serve more creditworthy borrowers and are more active in the refinancing market. Fintech lenders charge a premium of 14–16 basis points and appear to provide convenience rather than cost savings to borrowers. They seem to use different information to set interest rates relative to other lenders.

It is shown that fintech initiatives have not yet led to a radical transformation of the financial sector in Russia because participants of the fintech ecosystem have different points of view on fintech. Russian banks are now developing fintech initiatives within themselves, encouraging technology companies and fintech startups to focus their efforts on innovations that are aimed at improving processes, rather than opening new markets.

We further aim to offer various perspectives in order to aid the understanding of the disruptive potential of FinTech, and its implications for the wider financial ecosystem. By drawing upon very recent and highly topical research on this area this study examines the implications for financial institutions, and regulation especially when technology poses a challenge to the global banking and regulatory system. It is driven by a wide-ranging overview of the development, the current state, and possible future of fintech. This paper attempts to connect practitioner-led and academic research. While it draws on academic research, the perspective it takes is also practice-oriented. It relies on the current academic literature as well as insights from industry sources, action research and other publicly available commentaries. It also draws on professional practitioners’ roundtable discussions, and think-tanks in which the author has been an active participant. We attempt to interpret banking, and regulatory issues from a behavioural perspective. The last crisis exposed significant failures in regulation and supervision. It has made the Financial Market Law and Compliance a key topic on the current agenda. Disruptive technological change also seems to be important in investigating regulatory compliance followed by change. We contribute to the current literature review on financial and digital innovation by new entrants where this has also practical implications. We also provide for an updated review of the current regulatory issues addressing the contextual root causes of disruption within the financial services domain. The aim here is to assist market participants to improve effectiveness and collaboration. The difficulties arising from extensive regulation may suggest a more liberal and principled approach to financial regulation. Disruptive innovation has the potential for welfare outcomes for consumers, regulatory, and supervisory gains as well as reputational gains for the financial services industry. It becomes even more important as the financial services industry evolves. For example, the preparedness of the regulators to instil culture change and harmonise technological advancements with regulation could likely achieve many desired outcomes. Such results range from achieving an orderly market growth, further aiding systemic stability and restoring trust and confidence in the financial system. Our action-led research results have implications for both research and practice. These should be of interest to regulatory standard setters, investors, international organisations and other academics who are researching regulatory and competition issues, and their manifestation within the financial and social contexts. As a perspective on a social construct, this study appeals to regulators and law makers, entrepreneurs, and investors who participate in technology applied within the innovative financial services domain. It is also of interest to bankers who might consider FinTech and strategic partnerships as a prospective, future strategic direction.1 © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Business models; Financial services; FinTech; Future research direction; RegTech; Regulation","","","","","","","Finally, only a few companies around the world are able to quickly export their fintech/regtech products and services to other countries. These are usually the ‘first movers’ and they are strongly financed by established financial markets and supported by advanced technology-platforms for scaling. For smaller markets, the small and medium-sized companies potentially face the future scaling and funding problem. Such companies may already be partially successful in their respective markets but further expansion financing for growth and internationalisation can come across the ‘bottleneck’ consequence. Much of the decline in the number of ‘smaller’ companies becoming listed is attributed to the very difficulty of being a small public company; this is reflected in the actions of venture capitalists, who once sought public listings when they wanted to exit their investments and now overwhelmingly choose private sales (Ritter, Economist, 2018 ). There is thus the real potential that firms are going to seek strategic alliances with incumbent financial institutions within the sector as their survival strategy. The risk for promising fintech/start-up companies is that there is also the potential to be constricted under the pressure of having to meet invariable demands in the services and products they offer. As such the issue becomes one of scale and capacity against larger firms, possibly the incumbents or indeed technology giants (i.e. Amazon, Apple etc.). This is important as at this stage. This is an industry with no ‘made’, crisis-resistant, proven businesses thus far. We do not know yet whether start-ups are mentally prepared for ‘exchanges’ in order to finance growth. In an industry under exponential development, pure cash exits do not exist as well for venture capital nor do acquisition evaluation models of a ‘made’ fintech business exist. Established institutions have the scale to absorb this which potentially gives rise to growth through a mergers and acquisitions wave. A pragmatic way for mergers to go through at this point is via exchanges of shares. The dangers in such a scenario are the ‘old-new firms’ where they ‘grow-and-consume’ entrants.","Global Fintech Investment Growth Continues in 2016 Driven by Europe and Asia, (2016); Agarwal, Sumit, Inconsistent regulators: Evidence from banking, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 129, 2, pp. 889-938, (2014); Complex Regulatory Landscape for Fintech an Uncertain Future for Small and Medium Sized Enterprise Lending, (2016); undefined, (2018); Allen, Franklin, Financial intermediaries and markets, Econometrica, 72, 4, pp. 1023-1061, (2004); Understanding Financial Crises, (2007); Allen, Franklin, Bubbles and crises, Economic Journal, 110, 460, pp. 236-255, (2000); Allen, Franklin, Financial contagion, Journal of Political Economy, 108, 1, pp. 1-33, (2000); Arner, Douglas W., FinTech, regTech, and the reconceptualization of financial regulation, Northwestern Journal of International Law and Business, 37, 3, pp. 373-415, (2017); Evolution of Fintech A New Post Crisis Paradigm, (2015)","","","Elsevier Inc.","","","","","","01486195","","JEBUD","","English","J.

However, the current FinTech-industry still heavily depends on manual testing, which becomes the bottleneck of FinTech industry development. To automate the testing process, we propose an approach of black-box testing for a Fin- Tech system with effective tool support for both test generation and test oracles. For test generation, we first extract input categories from business-logic specifications, and then mutate real data collected from system logs with values randomly picked from each extracted input category. For test oracles, we propose a new technique of priority differential testing where we evaluate execution results of system-test inputs on the system's head (i.e., latest) version in the version repository (1) against the last legacy version in the version repository (only when the executed test inputs are on new, not-yet-deployed services) and (2) against both the currently-deployed version and the last legacy version (only when the test inputs are on existing, deployed services). When we rank the behavior-inconsistency results for developers to inspect, for the latter case, we give the currently-deployed version as a higherpriority source of behavior to check. We apply our approach to the CSTP subsystem, one of the largest data processing and forwarding modules of the China Foreign Exchange Trade System (CFETS) platform, whose annual total transaction volume reaches 150 trillion US dollars. Extensive experimental results show that our approach can substantially boost the branch coverage by approximately 40%, and is also efficient to identify common faults in the FinTech system. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Automated test generation; Black-box testing; FinTech","Automation; Data handling; Testing; Automated test generations; Deployed services; Differential testing; FinTech; Foreign exchange; Industry development; Software platforms; Test generations; Black-box testing","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1513939, 1564274, 1816615); National Science Foundation, NSF","","Global Fintech Investment Growth Continues in 2016, (2017); Jacoco Java Code Coverage Library, (2018); Cadar, Cristian, Klee: Unassisted and automatic generation of high-coverage tests for complex systems programs, pp. 209-224, (2019); Cadar, Cristian, EXE: Automatically generating inputs of death, Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 322-335, (2006); Fraser, Gordon, EvoSuite: Automatic test suite generation for object-oriented software, pp. 416-419, (2011); Hutchison, Casidhe, Robustness testing of autonomy software, Proceedings - International Conference on Software Engineering, pp. 276-285, (2018); Koopman, Philip J., Toward a scalable method for quantifying aspects of fault tolerance, software assurance, and computer security, 1998-November, pp. 103-131, (1998); Koopman, Philip J., Comparing operating systems using robustness benchmarks, Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems, pp. 72-79, (1997); Pacheco, Carlos, Randoop: Feedback-directed random testing for Java, Proceedings of the Conference on Object-Oriented Programming Systems, Languages, and Applications, OOPSLA, pp. 815-816, (2007); Taipale, Ossi, Trade-off between automated and manual software testing, International Journal of System Assurance Engineering and Management, 2, 2, pp. 114-125, (2011)","L.

With the increasing importance of bitcoin, many related topics require further clarification. Because bitcoin is a popular financial asset, determining whether the price information is fully circulated among trading platforms has been the focus of many studies in recent years. The method for verifying the efficient market hypothesis relates to whether the price series is a random walk; that is, whether a unit root exists. According to the literature, whether the price of bitcoin satisfies the efficient market hypothesis remains controversial; however, these studies have not considered nonlinear data structures. To deal with the structural change of data, this study employed different unit root tests, namely the Zivot-Andrews unit root test and Kapetanios-Shin unit root test, to investigate bitcoins' relationship to the efficient market hypothesis. If the efficient market hypothesis is validated, the price formed by the bitcoin trading platform is close to a perfectly competitive mechanism, and the information can be quickly and completely reflected in the price, with information of different trading platforms having mutual influence. Therefore, this study applied the threshold vector autoregressive model to explore price information transmission between various trading platforms. The contribution of this research is its exploration of the financial tools derived from the highly developed fields of financial science and technology. This is helpful for providing new methods for completing financial transactions or a platform for speculators to engage in arbitrage. © 2018 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology, Inc.

This paper clarified that FinTech modularizes financial technology. For that purpose, we analyzed the function and structure of FinTech. Also, although it is possible that FinTech could change the existing financial industry structure in Japan, the objective was to propose from the case consideration that the management strategy in that environment is Keystone Strategy. As a conclusion, FinTech was found to be modularized because it has increased its added value after fragmenting financial services technology and breaking it apart. In addition, even if it continues to stay in the integral part, its comprehensive financial services part is inferior to FinTech, so it was expected that it cannot stay in the integral. © 2018 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology, Inc.

Fintech startups, high-tech firms but also mobile network operators are indeed challenging the status quo with their innovative propositions, trying to disintermediate banks from their traditional function of payment service providers. In the payments market, mobile wallets represent one of the innovations with highest potential of growth in the consumer-to-business segment. Payment market is a large and profitable segment for retail banking. Besides revenue streams from card payment transactions, new sources of revenueas and value creation have been unleashed by digital payments. This paper contributes to provide a better understanding of the mobile wallet ecosystem, also analyzing a set of four business cases so to identify potential sources of competitive advantage for retail banks in a market characterized by an increased non-bank competition.

In this paper, we examine the determinants of the use of FinTech finance by businesses, with a particular focus on the ownership, governance, and business practices that may modify the relationships with conventional motivations for external finance. Using a comprehensive sample of Chinese hi-tech small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), we find that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and family firms and financially constrained firms are respectively much less and much more likely to seek FinTech finance. In the Chinese context, we argue that part of this may be because of the relative ease with which SOE SMEs can access cheaper conventional finance through SOE banks. The quality of traditional relationship banking also affects the relative desirability of FinTech financing. As for family firms, we find that innovation, as exemplified by RD activity, effectively overrides any conventional reluctance to access external finance, suggesting the relative benefits of FinTech finance for innovative high-growth firms. © 2018 IEEE.","China; family firms; fintech; Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); state-owned enterprises (SOEs)","Engineering; Industrial engineering; China; Family firms; fintech; Small and medium-sized enterprise; State owned enterprise; Finance","","","","","","","Dorfleitner, Gregor, FinTech in Germany, pp. 1-121, (2017); Zhu, Xiaodong, Understanding China's growth: Past, present, and future, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 26, 4, pp. 103-124, (2012); Boycko, Maxim, A theory of privatisation, Economic Journal, 106, 435, pp. 309-319, (1996); Megginson, William Leon Bill, From state to market: A survey of empirical studies on privatization, Journal of Economic Literature, 39, 2, pp. 321-389, (2001); Econometrica, (1979); Economics of Shortage, (1980); Allen, Franklin, Law, finance, and economic growth in China, Journal of Financial Economics, 77, 1, pp. 57-116, (2005); Jensen, Michael C., Theory of the firm: Managerial behavior, agency costs and ownership structure, Journal of Financial Economics, 3, 4, pp. 305-360, (1976); Megginson, William Leon Bill, State ownership, soft-budget constraints, and cash holdings: Evidence from China's privatized firms, Journal of Banking and Finance, 48, pp. 276-291, (2014); Beck, Thorsten, Financing patterns around the world: Are small firms different?, Journal of Financial Economics, 89, 3, pp. 467-487, (2008)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","1st Annual International Symposium on Innovation and Entrepreneurship of the IEEE Technology and Engineering Management Society, TEMS-ISIE 2018","2018-03-30 through 2018-04-01","Beijing","140367","","9781538644751","","","English","TEMS-ISIE - Annu.

The rapid changes in technology due to the innovation has brought an impacts in changes on human lifestyle. Technology simplifies and accelerates human being in doing its activity. The development of digital technology (disruptive technology) has an impact on all aspects of human life. The purpose of this research is to see the phenomenon of the conventional banking in Indonesia to make changes in its business processes in order to compete with Fintechs Company that is growing rapidly. This research method looks at the phenomenon on conventional banking in Indonesia by looking at the impact of technology and digital. The first phenomenon is the rapid development in the world currently occur in the digital economy, one of which is a digital-based financial service known as financial technology (FinTech). The second phenomenon is digital technology has been able to change the behavior of Indonesian people in all aspects of life, such as electronic books, electronic newspapers, online sales and public transportation (taxis and motorcycles). The third phenomenon is FinTechs services in Indonesia include Payment channel system, Digital Banking, Online/Digital Insurance, Peer-to-peer (P2P) Lending and Crow funding. Banks should be able to balance the development of this digital technology by providing new products that are close to customer's wishes. There is a gap that has not been served by banks in Indonesia that resulted in the emergence of potential benefits that can be taken by Start-up Company (pioneer) FinTech in providing services and banking products. Banking in Indonesia can synergize with start-up companies (pioneer) FinTech by changing its business process by doing Business Process Reengineering (BPR). © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Finance; Peer to peer networks; Reengineering; Business process re-engineering; Digital technologies; Disruptive technology; Financial service; Potential benefits; Public transportation; research methods; Start-up companies; Electronic publishing","","","","","","","Financial Technology Trend Bisnis Keuangan Ke Depan, (2016); Financial Technology Fintech Di Indonesia Kuliah Umum Tentang Fintech Ibs, (2017); International Journal of Management Research and Review, (2011); Ringim, Kabiru Jinjiri, Exploring the implementation of business process reengineering in banks, Asian Social Science, 9, 11, pp. 243-253, (2013); Journal of US China Public Administration, (2015); Datamation, (1993); Barrett, John L., Process visualization getting the vision right is key, Information Systems Management, 11, 2, pp. 14-23, (1994); Information Systems Management Summer, (1993); Management Services, (1997); Al-Mashari, Majed A., BPR implementation process: An analysis of key success and failure factors, Business Process Management Journal, 5, 1, pp. 87-112, (1999)","","Abdullah, A.G.; Nandiyanto, A.B.D.; Warlina, L.; Kurniati, P.S.","Institute of Physics Publishing helen.craven@iop.org","","International Conference on Informatics, Engineering, Science and Technology, INCITEST 2018","2018-05-09 through 2018-05-10","Bandung","140092","17578981","","","","English","IOP Conf.

This growth indicates that people behaviour change in many aspects of life including in economy. One example is (Fintech P2P Lending). P2P lending is a service that offers online borrowing, lenders can loan to small business or individuals. This is in line with the Indonesia Financial Services Sector Master Plan 2015-2019. Indonesia support the rapid growth of the financial technology ecosystem, but there is need good understanding between related parties such as P2P Lending companies, lenders and borrowers. A system dynamics act as calculators to takes value to fill payoff table in game theory. Integration of system dynamics and game theory can produce the best strategy for Fintech P2P Lending in running its business while considering profit for lenders and borrowers. The best strategy is known by use non-cooperative and cooperative game theory. The result shown the best strategy for each player with non-cooperative game is when the company chooses a high level of profit margin, borrower chooses low level of debt time, and lender chooses high level of ROI. In cooperative game, the best strategy is when the company chooses a high level of profit margin, borrower chooses low level of debt time, and lender chooses low level of ROI. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.","","","","","","","","","Jakarta, (2017); Data Society Research Institute, (2015); G20 High Level Principles for Digital Financial Inclusion; Centria University of Applied Science, (2016); Issn Tangerang, (2017); Erman Researchgate, (2017); undefined, (2016); Springer, (2014); Safety Science, (2015); undefined","D.S.

Fintech has the potential to change financial intermediation structures substantially. It could disrupt existing intermediation with new business models empowered by intelligent algorithms, big data, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. Lower costs and potentially better consumer experiences could be the driving forces. Yet, empirically, fintech remains very small, especially in the European Union (EU). Even the largest fintech market, in China, is of marginal size compared to overall financial intermediation. In the EU, much of fintech is concentrated in the UK. We argue that policymakers need to consider four questions urgently. (i) Develop a European or national fintech market? (ii) What regulatory framework to pursue? (iii) Should supervision of fintech be exercised at the European level? (iv) What is the overall vision for the EU's financial system? Getting the answers to these questions right at an early stage of market development constitutes an opportunity to shape a stable and cost-efficient financial system. In contrast, late action could mean that Europe loses out to foreign competitors and misses an opportunity to improve financial intermediation in Europe. © The Author(s) 2018.

The states have historically overseen and regulated nonbank companies, including nonbank financial services providers like money transmitters, mortgage lenders, consumer lenders, and debt collectors. Applicable regulations include state safety and soundness requirements and both state and federal consumer protection and anti-money laundering laws. In 2016, the OCC announced its intention to create a new national bank charter for nonbank companies, thus pulling chartered nonbank fintech companies into the national bank regulatory system. This will potentially preempt and replace the licensing, regulation, and supervision responsibilities of state authorities while allowing circumvention of other regulatory safeguards. Moreover, this power grab by the OCC is beyond its authority as delegated by Congress. In addition to questions of the legality of the charters and whether state or federal regulators are better situated to regulate such institutions, the proposed charters raise significant concerns regarding the separation of commerce and banking that has been a hallmark of the U.S. financial regulatory system since the founding of the country. © 2018 George Washington University.

What is the role of institutional factors on the international allocation of fintech venture capital? Research Findings/Insights: We document a notable change in the pattern of fintech venture capital (VC) investments around the world relative to other types of investments after the global financial crisis. We show that fintech venture capital investments are relatively more common in countries with weaker regulatory enforcement and without a major financial center after the financial crisis. Also, we show the fintech boom is more pronounced for smaller private limited partnership venture capitalists that likely have less experience with prior venture capital booms and busts. These fintech VC deals are substantially more likely to be liquidated, especially when located in countries without a major financial center. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We build on the institutions and corporate governance literatures by showing the importance of enforcement in driving relative differences in investment patterns and investor participation. For entrepreneurial startups, regulatory arbitrage drives investment into countries with a dearth of enforcement and regulatory costs. We argue that the spike in fintech venture capital in certain countries is attributable to differential enforcement of financial institution rules amongst startups versus large established financial institutions after the financial crisis. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Regulatory arbitrage in the context of fintech venture capital can spur booms and busts. Less experienced venture capitalists seem more prone to undertake investments that exacerbate boom and bust cycles. National governance is strengthened by the enforcement of regulatory standards, and corporate governance through investor experience and oversight can mitigate these swings, and facilitate better investment outcomes. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Corporate Governance; Financial Regulation; Fintech; International Venture Capital; Regulatory Arbitrage","","","","","","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC","Funding text 1: The authors owe thanks to Lars Hornuf, Joseph McCahery, Elisa Ughetto, Silvio Vismara, and to the conference participants at McCarthy Tétrault, Toronto, March 2016, the 4th Crowdinvesting Symposium on “Financial Decision Making and the Internet” at the Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition, Munich, November 2016, and the CGIR Workshop on “Corporate Governance Implications of New Methods of Entrepreneurial Firm Formation”, University of Bergamo, June 2017, and the 5th Crowdinvesting Symposium on “The Regulation of FinTechs” at the Humboldt University of Berlin, October 2017.

The emergence of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) has changed the way humans interact with the surrounding world. In this paper, we present a proactive FinTech model that uses the IoT intelligence to deliver positive InsurTech feedback. We propose an InsurTech system with three main components: the monitoring and feedback device, the fog analytics engine, and the cloud server. The driving analytics use sensor-recorded data to calculate in real time the driving scores based on current driving patterns and road conditions. The feedback device then communicates with drivers providing helpful feedbacks and potential rewards. Given assertive recommendations offered by a system, the rational-economic model suggests that humans usually respond positively to cost minimizations and rewards maximizations. We have used real user data collected by the MapBar Auto Guard devices deployed in China to show an example of how IoT supports the implementation of the positive feedback paradigm. We believe our proactive FinTech model that speaks of actual costs and potential benefits in real time will offer an attractive service value and customer satisfaction. © 2018 IEEE.","Feedback; Fintech; InsurTech; UBI","Customer satisfaction; Internet of things; Cost minimization; Economic modeling; Fintech; InsurTech; Internet of thing (IOT); Potential benefits; Potential rewards; Technological advancement; Feedback","","","","","","","Lee, In, Fintech: Ecosystem, business models, investment decisions, and challenges, Business Horizons, 61, 1, pp. 35-46, (2018); Proceedings in International Conference on Information Systems Held at Dublin, (2016); Dhar, Vasant, Economic and business dimensions: FinTech platforms and strategy, Communications of the ACM, 60, 10, pp. 32-35, (2017); Zavolokina, Liudmila, The FinTech phenomenon: antecedents of financial innovation perceived by the popular press, Financial Innovation, 2, 1, (2016); Fin Ternet of Things how Iot Affects Financial Services, (2018); Al-Fuqaha, Ala Isam, Internet of Things: A Survey on Enabling Technologies, Protocols, and Applications, IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials, 17, 4, pp. 2347-2376, (2015); Gartner Research, (2017); Next Industrial Revolution, (2017); European Insurance, (2016); Global Fintech Survey, (2016)","","Brichni, M.; Huemer, C.; Proper, H.A.; Rozier, D.; Guerreiro, S.; Guedria, W.; Razo-Zapata, I.; Komarov, M.M.; Strecker, S.; Feltus, C.; Maltseva, S.V.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","20th IEEE International Conference on Business Informatics, CBI 2018","2018-07-11 through 2018-07-13","Vienna","139250","","9781538670163","","","English","Proceeding - IEEE Int.

Fin-tech itself can be described as an industry composed of companies that use new technology and innovation with available resources in order to compete in the marketplace of traditional financial institutions and intermediaries in the delivery of financial services. In Indonesia, Fin-tech has been widely developed in the past 3 years. Fin-tech is facing a new challenge as a new service for financial consumer which adapts new way of living in modern digital technology era. Basically, Fin-tech is offering three main categories such as payment, personal finance and financing. In financing application there are peer to peer financing, social crowd funding and also loan marketplace. All of this kind application has some issues in legal framework and data protection due to the using of communication technologies such as internet, social networks, Smartphone, massive use of data with the Big Data, connected objects etc. The using of big data and those new technologies have created new opportunities for these sectors, these developments also raise significant data protection concerns. This paper will discuss two legal issues of Fin-tech, the legal aspect and the data protection. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Consumer; Data Protection; Financial Technology","Big data; Commerce; Data privacy; Economic and social effects; Environmental protection; Facings; Finance; Fins (heat exchange); Peer to peer networks; Planning; Social sciences computing; Sustainable development; Communication technologies; Connected objects; Consumer; Digital technologies; Financial institution; Financial service; New technologies; Technology service; Consumer protection","","","","","Foundation for Contemporary Arts","Up to July 2017, a total of 180 startup fin-tech has been operating in Indonesia. Looking this situation, the Indonesian government responds quickly this phenomenon. Indonesia Financial Service Authority (OJK) and Indonesian Central Bank (BI) release new regulations regarding fin-tech service. Although not directly address fin-tech in specific; however, this regulations at least provides an opportunity for fin-tech to flourish. This means that the government responds to this situation well. OJK released regulation POJK No.77/POJK.01/2016 regarding Money Lending Services Based on Information Technology. Meanwhile, BI released PBI No. 18/40/PBI/2016 on Management Processing of Payment Transactions. The two regulations regulate the two most important things in the fin-tech service: peer to peer lending system and payment gateway system. Regulations issued by OJK and BI adopting the Regulatory Sandbox. What does it mean with Regulatory Sandbox? Regulatory Sandbox introduced by The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the financial body in United Kingdom in April 2016. Basically Regulatory Sandbox is a set of regulation which allows both fin-tech startups and established company to test their innovative product in the area of Fin-Tech. It is yet the best approach when dealing with the new technology. Regulators promote the innovation to grow faster and bigger by lowering barriers but still protect the consumers from the harmful effect of new product.","Schueffel, Patrick, Taming the beast: A scientific definition of fintech, Journal of Innovation Management, 4, 4, pp. 32-54, (2016); Evolution of Fintech, (2015); Evolution of Fintech A New Post Crisis Paradigm, (2015); Penetrasi Dan Perilaku Pengguna Internet Indonesia, (2016); Indonesian Fintech Report, (2016); Regulation Tomorrow What Happens When Technology is Faster than the Law, (2016); Marketeers, (2017); Business Models and Economics of Peer to Peer Lending, (2016); Fintech World and New Styles in Payment, (2016); Applications of Blockchain Technology in Fintech, (2017)","","","Institute of Physics Publishing helen.craven@iop.org","","International Conference on Industrial Technology for Sustainable Development 2017, ICon-ITSD 2017","2017-10-25 through 2017-10-26","Makassar","138331","17551307","","","","English","IOP Conf.

Various types of technology based innovative financial business models or financial technology (fin-tech) are growing rapidly around the world, including Indonesia. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) incorporates the fin-tech progress in its work plan in 2017 in the perspective of financial stability. In Indonesia, the Financial Services Authority has issued the Financial Services Authority Regulation No: 77/FSAR.01/2016 on Technology-Based Lending and Borrowing Services to provide a legal basis for fin-tech activities, in particular services with peer to peer lending models. In practice, fin-tech in Indonesia is not only used to facilitate lending and borrowing, but also used for other business models, especially start-up business, investment and social activities, which are not included in the scope of lending and borrowing. On the other hand, fin-tech development in Indonesia is expected to contribute to economic development, particularly in facilitating micro, small and medium enterprises to gain access to finance. The advantages of fin-tech include cost efficiency and ease of access to finance, but on the other hand there are some obstacles and risks that potentially arise, such as credit risk, insufficient technology, misuse of funds and user/consumer data and protection of national interests such as money laundering as well as disruption to monetary stability. Therefore, in addition to the need for comprehensive regulation, supervisory aspects by the financial services authorities are urgently needed to make fin-tech a part of the financial services sector. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Fin-tech- legal challenges- financial industry","Economics; Fins (heat exchange); Investments; Planning; Risk assessment; Sustainable development; Authority regulations; Economic development; Financial industry; Financial services sector; Financial stability; Peer-to-peer lending; Small and medium enterprise; Technology advances; Economic and social effects","","","","","","","Journal of Financial Transformation, (2016); Journal of Financial Perspectives, (2015); Director of Supervision and Fin Tech Licensing Only 7 Fintech Companies Listed in Fsa; There are 600 Fintech in Indonesia Only 157 are Reported to Fsa, (2017); Fintech Innovation an Overview, (2016); Message from Bank Indonesia Governor Launching Bank Indonesia Fintech Office, (2016)","","","Institute of Physics Publishing helen.craven@iop.org","","International Conference on Industrial Technology for Sustainable Development 2017, ICon-ITSD 2017","2017-10-25 through 2017-10-26","Makassar","138331","17551307","","","","English","IOP Conf.

The task of integrating such system is quite complicated, especially the integration of the financial technology system. In addition to being integrated, the flow of data and business processes must effectively reach every part which has interests in the process and the data. Business productivity can be achieved if the required data flows smoothly and is accessible as efficient as possible. Similarly, a bank which usually uses more than one information systems, when it need to combine financial statements from different bank systems must go through a data transformation mechanism to be accessible. Especially if the users of some bank accounts must access all their banking accounts at one time, of course, this would not be easy. As a response to those situations, in this research we proposed a financial technology application integration based on SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) which could be used to combine financials statements of all integrated banks every month. The data required to create a composite report will be directly taken from the system of any bank by utilizing web services. It is expected that the results from this study could help the parties interested in SOA-based Fin Tech with the understanding and description of SOA, such as: how it works, its benefits, and the role of SOA layers implemented in Fin Tech applications. © 2018 IEEE.","Architecture; Fin Tech; SOA; System","Architecture; Citrus fruits; Finance; Fins (heat exchange); Information services; Integration; Metadata; Web services; Business productivity; Customer expectation; Fin Tech; Financial transactions; Soa (serviceoriented architecture); System; Technology application; Technology Integration; Service oriented architecture (SOA)","","","","","","","Communications of the ACM, (2003); Meredith, L.

The blockchain technology threatens to be even more disruptive as it may pull the carpet from under the monetary system as well as the property rights as we know them today.

Recent years have seen a remarkable trend for companies in all business sectors and industries to try to improve and extend the lifetime of their existing businesses and services by introducing the newest technologies. There is a requirement for FinTech or IoT to be integrated into the society in order to move beyond this goal, and to create new business models or services that are not descended from their existing business fields or services itself. While some simply maintain existing business areas that lack potential for company development, several companies find it difficult to develop business through advanced concepts, because they are bound by their existing capabilities. Thus, there is a need to find ways to create the business models and services that surpass vested interests, are sustainable, and which fulfil the demands of the society. Products and services using technology have been in demand through the years, and occasionally, they can actually threaten the survival of existing businesses; this clearly demonstrates that such products and services are truly indispensable for social creation. This paper aims to discuss the conceptualization of approaches necessary to create such products and services, and to provide ideas for new services by introducing examples. © 2018","Business model; FinTech; Innovation; IoT; Mobility","Carrier mobility; Business modeling; Business models; Business sector; Company development; FinTech; New business models; New services; Products and services; Internet of things","","","","","","","undefined, (2010); undefined, (2010)","T.

Hundreds of mobile payment services have been introduced across the globe. Strikingly, many of these efforts have failed. This study analyzes whether mobile payment is still relevant in the fintech era. I compare three mobile payment projects – Oi Paggo in Brazil, TCASH in Indonesia, and M-PESA in Kenya – as case studies. I argue that mobile payment systems currently operate in such complex and multidimensional networks with shared common infrastructures and compete for producing and providing value to the customers on the basis of these infrastructures. Three attributes of industry and network structure are immediately of interest: (1) cutting the vertical supply chain more finely may encourage large players to extend their domination, (2) the basic platform continues to be governed by multinational operators (MNOs) – telecom firms, and (3) openness may be decreasing or increasing even as the number of independent parties in the supply chain drops. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Case study methods; Developing countries; Financial services; Financial transactions; Fintech; Innovation; Mobile payment; Modularity; Networks; Payment networks; Platforms; Technology ecosystems","Developing countries; Finance; Global system for mobile communications; Networks (circuits); Supply chains; Case study methods; Financial service; Financial transactions; Fintech; Mobile payment; Modularity; Platforms; Technology ecosystem; Electronic money","","","","","","","Adomavicius, Gediminas, Making sense of technology trends in the information technology landscape: A design science approach, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 32, 4, pp. 779-809, (2008); Adomavicius, Gediminas, Understanding evolution in technology ecosystems, Communications of the ACM, 51, 10, pp. 117-122, (2008); Au, Yoris A., The economics of mobile payments: Understanding stakeholder issues for an emerging financial technology application, Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 7, 2, pp. 141-164, (2008); Baldwin, Carliss Y., Where do transactions come from?

Financial services companies are trying to become more customer focused, but struggling to help huge customer segments, particularly in developing economies. Alternative financial models and tools are emerging, which are being embraced by consumers and incumbents. In large parts of the developing world, alternative services are leapfrogging traditional finance, meaning more and more people have access to finance without ever needing a bank. Meanwhile, the barriers around financial services companies are crumbling, as they become more reliant on integration with new providers and alternative types of service. Financial products can no longer be viewed in isolation, but as part of a service landscape that supports how people do life. This means rethinking how our businesses are designed, motivated and organised, and letting go of the old ways of thinking about supply and demand. With practical steps businesses and, in particular, financial services organisations need to take to participate in a global service ecosystem, this book will be of interest to financial professionals who work in banking, financial technology, and development finance. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2018.

Users’ perceived ease of use is the strongest influenced by mobile payment knowledge, whereas personal innovativeness is the most influential factor to the usefulness of mobile payment.

But the financial regulatory reforms enacted since the crisis have been premised on an outdated idea of what financial services look like and how they are provided. Regulation has failed to take into account the rise of financial technology (or ""fintech"") firms and the fundamental changes they have ushered in on a variety of fronts, from the way that banking works, to the way that capital is raised, even to the very form of money itself. These changes call for a wide-ranging reconceptualization of financial regulation in an era of technology-enabled finance. In particular, this Article argues that regulators' focus on preventing the risks associated with ""too big to fail"" institutions overlooks the conceptually distinct risks associated with small, decentralized financial markets. In many ways, these risks can be greater than those presented by large institutions because decentralized fintech markets are more vulnerable to adverse economic shocks, less transparent to regulators, and more likely to encourage excessively risky behavior by market participants. The Article concludes by sketching out a variety of regulatory responses that better correspond to fintech's particular risks and rewards. © 2017 Vanderbilt Law Review.

These efforts have given rise to numerous approaches, including, most notably, fintech-bank partnerships structured to avoid state licensing regimes. While another obvious option is a bank charter, few fintech firms have seriously considered bank charters due to a number of cost, compliance and other factors that make becoming a bank too burdensome. Recent developments, however, suggest that the bank charter option may be worthy of reconsideration. This article explores the opportunities, costs, risks and other factors that fintech firms should weigh in considering a bank charter and various charter options currently available or in development in the United States. Notably, the scope of this article does not include non-U.S. charter and similar options, of which there are a number of alternatives, including in the UK, Singapore and other jurisdictions. © 2018 Banking Law Journal.

Despite access to fast-paced technology known as FinTech, an antiquated business model and internal organizational paralysis do not allow for the creation of a truly beloved brand and are stifling change. To survive and thrive when their competition is catching up, banks must understand the principles behind Emotional Banking-a cultural change concept that brings the consumer to the center of rethinking banking products and delivery. This book starts with a history of the space then moves into an overview of what FinTech is. After discussing the state of banking today including stories from the biggest names in the industry, the concept of Emotional Banking and Brand are introduced as an answer to the problems outlined above. It concludes with examples of best practices and a hands-on approach on how to change the inertia, become a brand and make customers fall in love with their bank. Some of the questions this book tackles include: · Why don't banks ""care""? · How many banks will survive? · What is FinTech and why does it matter? · Can Banks become beloved brands and find their way to the consumer's heart? · Why is there a disconnect between what we say and what we do in the industry? · Is inertia in banking a result of broken internal culture? · Which big brand or challenger will be at the top in 5 years? © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2018.

Re-visiting past and present discourses can be illuminating in at least three ways: it can reveal the broader picture of the present financialized and technologized world and the rise of financial technologies; it can provide scholars with new vocabularies, concepts, and metaphors to comprehend present-day phenomena and developments; and it can reveal the variety of commitments that are possible, today, too. This article starts with a discussion of the original ‘crisis of modernity’ discourses (avant la lettre), in which the clashing arguments of Comte and Tocqueville are featured, and a discussion of a second ‘crisis of modernity’ that developed in the context of the ‘Great Depression.’ A third ‘crisis of modernity’ discourse emerged in the wake of the financial crises of the 1970s. Such crises are still ongoing and discussed within the boundaries of the third ‘crisis of modernity’ discourse. How financial technologies do and do not fit within this third discourse is discussed in the remainder of this article. © 2017, The Author(s).","Crisis; Democracy; Financial technologies; Financialization; Ideology; Mechanization modernity discourses","","","","","","University of Twente","","Abolafia, Mitchel Y., Can speculative bubbles be managed?

This means that Fintech companies, who could so far often rely on a comparatively lenient regulatory regime, will now have to give serious thoughts on compliance with applicable regulatory rules. Operating in a highly regulated environment is tedious, but not all bad-companies that can play the regulatory game well have a strategic advantage, especially with regard to time-to-market and scaling. Nothing spells missed opportunity like a competitor building market share with a copycat product whilst you are still waiting for your license! Written for professionals, this book helps anyone whose job has to do with formulating or executing a Fintech startup strategy or whose job touches financial services regulation, or anyone who simply wants an easy- to-read introduction to financial services and their regulation. • Describes the purpose of and principle behind modern financial services regulation • Explains how to include regulation into a startup's strategic planning to optimize time-to-market and scaling • Gives an overview of the entire financial services space, and which regulations apply where • Gives detailed references to 20 key regulations in the EU regulatory system, including PSD, GDPR, CRD, AMLD, MiFID, UCITSD, AIFMD The first part introduces financial services regulation, its purpose, how it is created (especially in the EU and in the US), and it develops a framework for including regulations into the strategic planning of a company. It also gives a rundown of the current financial services space-players and products-and its key regulations. The second part describes a regulatory system in more detail. The system chosen is the EU because it is more consistent and unified than the US system where a lot of the regulation still is created at the state-level. However, as most financial regulation nowadays is determined at the global level, the principles found in EU regulation will be by and large also be found the US and other systems. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Nonetheless, in recent years, FinTechs - un-regulated start-ups applying technology to finance - have exponentially accelerated such race, making innovative regulatory approaches and new perspectives necessary. The present paper discusses relevant issues pertaining to the regulation of FinTech, using financial-return crowdfunding (FR-crowdfunding) as case study and model, deriving from its FinTech, shadow banking and collaborative economy natures, important indications for regulators. Current trends in regulating FR-crowdfunding in Member States are also analysed, together with related shortcomings and benefits, with the view to proposing a more harmonised regime for the sector, tailored to its risks and features and advancing Capital Markets Union objectives. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","","","","","","","","","Journal of Finance, (1981); American Economic Review, (1988); Financial Innovation, (1992); Oxford Handbook of Banking, (2014); Consequences of Financial Innovation A Counterfactual Research Agenda, (2011); Financial Innovation Too Much or Too Little, (2013); SMU L Rev, (1998); Miller, Merton H., Financial Innovation: The Last Twenty Years and the Next, Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 21, 4, pp. 459-471, (1986); Financial Innovation, (1999); Financial Innovation","","","Walter de Gruyter GmbH","","","","","","16132548","","","","English","Eur.

Indeed, the propensity toward complexity is considerable, bridging a range of financial services, markets, innovations, industry participants, infrastructures, and technologies. This study aims to improve comprehension of the global fintech landscape. It is based on the analysis of start-ups that participated in SWIFT's Innotribe competition. We used cluster analysis to group 402 fintech start-up firms, and then selected representative cases to create a foundational understanding of the structure of the fintech landscape. The main findings of this work are: (1) the development of fintech clusters to classify core services, business infrastructures, and underlying component technologies, which characterize fintech; (2) an analysis of how fintechs synthesize different technologies to restructure flows of financial information through competitive and cooperative mechanisms of disinter-mediation, extension of access, financialization, hybridization, and personalization; (3) an analysis of related strategies for value creation connected with the competitive and cooperative mechanisms that were identified.

In the past decade, these digital applications have profoundly restructured economic development and power relations in Chinese society. This article examines how the promotions of fintech media and communication technologies for transactions, loans, investments and many other financial practices–engender and enlarge Alibaba’s digital financial platform, Ant Financial, the largest digital financial company in China. From a political economy of communication perspective, we consider Ant Financial as a product of data-centric corporate convergence in which fintech media have extracted user data from Alibaba’s e-commerce and digital payment platforms and utilized this data to drive Alibaba’s growth in financial businesses. The consolidation of multiple platforms has transformed financial industries, challenged policy and regulatory regimes, and reshaped the cultures of finance in China. The convergence paradigm underpins the digital, technology-driven logic facilitated by the state in resource allocation and policy-making. The government’s supportive role is a vital condition for the rise of Chinese fintech giants such as Baidu Finance, Ant Financial, Tencent Finance, and Jingdong Finance. © The Author 2018","China; convergence; fintech; fintech media; platform economy","","","","","","","","Some Simple Economics of Crowdfunding, (2013); Ahlers, Gerrit K.C., Signaling in Equity Crowdfunding, Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, 39, 4, pp. 955-980, (2015); We Will Keep Your Money Safe; Why Ant Financials Ipo is Hugely Anticipated, (2017); Belleflamme, Paul, The economics of crowdfunding platforms, Information Economics and Policy, 33, pp. 11-28, (2015); Bormann, Ernest G., Symbolic Convergence Theory: A Communication Formulation, Journal of Communication, 35, 4, pp. 128-138, (1985); Peers Inc how People and Platforms are Inventing the Collaborative Economy and Reinventing Capitalism, (2015); Platform Scale how an Emerging Business Model Helps Startups Build Large Empires with Minimum Investment, (2015); Matchmakers the New Economics of Multisided Platforms, (2016); Political Economy of Communication, (2018)","","","International Association of Media Communication Research","","","","","","","","","","English","Polit.

The multiple case studies examine topics such as: the adoption of online banking in Sweden; the identification and classification of different FinTech categories; process innovation developments within the traditional banking industry; and the Venture Capital (VC) landscape in Sweden, as shown through interviews with VC representatives, mainly from Sweden but also from the US and Germany, as well as offering insight into the companies that are currently operating in the FinTech arena in Sweden. The authors address questions such as: How will the regulatory landscape shape the future of FinTech companies? What are the factors that will likely drive the adoption of FinTech services in the future? What is the future role of banks in the context of FinTech and digitalization? What are the policies and government initiatives that aim to support the FinTech ecosystem in Sweden? Complex concepts and ideas are rendered in an easily digestible yet thought-provoking way. The book was initiated by the IIS (the Internet Foundation in Sweden), an independent organization promoting the positive development of the Internet in the country. It is also responsible for the Internet’s Swedish top-level domain .se, including the registration of domain names, and the administration and technical maintenance of the national domain name registry. The book illustrates how Sweden acts (or does not act) as a competitive player in the global FinTech arena, and is a vital addition to students and practitioners in the field. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Robin Teigland, Shahryar Siri, Anthony Larsson, Alejandro Moreno Puertas, and Claire Ingram Bogusz; individual chapters, the contributors.","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis","","","","","","","9781351183611; 9780815378501","","","English","The Rise and Development of FinTech: Accounts of Disruption from Sweden and Beyond","Book","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168436371"

Fintech may contribute to solutions by reinventing the business models. There are various players in the fintech universe: the old established incumbent banks, the completely fresh start-ups and the mega tech companies. The fintech regulatory framework in many countries is still new or under considerable development and may otherwise conflict with existing securities regulation. Islamic finance has an opportunity to expand by being at the cutting edge of such developments. Regulators are open to discussions about new ways of working; Islamic finance participants should grasp this opportunity. Most Muslim economists propose using profit/loss sharing as the favoured mode of finance and being as modest as possible even with the permissible debt modes. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Umar A.

Fintech is a new way of finance by providing innovative products that would improve existing practices and facilitate consumers’ experiences in transactions in an efficient and effective way. Fintech offers product innovation by structuring financial products that are new or significantly improved and enhanced with respect to their characteristics or intended uses. Innovation through fintech should be explored to emphasis the value proposition of Islamic finance such as how to use technology to ensure minimal risk in the musharakah and mudarabah models of financing or how istisna’a and salam can be operated and optimised using fintech. Fintech solutions should be guided by the broad principles of Shari‘ah by avoiding the prohibited elements in transactions, such as interest, gambling, uncertainty, harms, cheating.

It also discusses maqasid al-Shari‘ah and fintech and provides a maqasid theoretical framework necessary for developing the dimensions and elements for measuring the fintech solutions in Islamic finance. The chapter explores the various dimensions of the essential of mal in the literature, which can be categorised into three: Shari‘ah value proposition, development of mal and socio-economic welfare.

With the exception of a few books on fintech published in earlier years, most leading books on fintech were published in 2016 due to the novelty of the phenomenon. Fintech in Islamic finance should be generally understood in a broad manner as Islamic financial services transcend mere banking. For the purpose of identifying the applicable Shariah principles, it may be helpful to define fintech in its general sense and identify its different components and applications. One key aspect of fintech which is conspicuously missing in the ongoing discussions and application of fintech in Islamic financial services and products is online dispute resolution.

It considers how the regulation of technology usage in the financial services landscape is important to avoiding financial crime. The chapter also provides case studies from countries such as Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan, who are taking a lead in regulating fintech and digital currency usage. It examines an example from Malaysia to demonstrate how a central bank is taking the lead by issuing a fintech regulatory sandbox. Fintech powered by blockchain technology has huge importance for the financial services industry and can come in handy to solve problems such as delays, cost, duplication and reconciliation.

There may be a need for fintech-specific Shari‘ah and Shari‘ah-governance standards by the Islamic finance industry’s standard-setting bodies such as Accounting and Auditing Organisation for Islamic Financial Institutions and Islamic Financial Services Board. Shariah scholars, as well as the industry’s standard-setting bodies and freelancers, are expected to work towards surmounting the challenges of new developments in fintech solutions in Islamic finance. Islamic financial institutions can benefit from fintech by developing products that can be easily accessed by everyone in any part of the globe which should also be cost effective, for example, mobicash in Pakistan, M-pesa in Kenya and “TransferWise” in the United Kingdom.

It explains the opportunities and challenges for Islamic finance. The Islamic financial industry is young, highly technological and with the excess liquidity required to finance innovation. The Islamic finance industry has reacted more quickly than its conventional counterparts, in two fundamental areas; developing innovation in its own capacity and partnering with new Shari‘ah-compliant fintech ventures. Fintech offers a way whereby new technologies can help channel Islamic principles to create a new generation of financial products that can satisfy the demands of future generations.

The platform that leverages on the advance and innovative financial technology system, or fintech, offers a safe and regulated investment ecosystem with better outreach and enhanced visibility to the ventures while the investors enjoy a greater transparency and disclosure on the listed ventures. The introduction of an investment account under the Islamic Financial Services Act regime marked another stage in the evolution of the Malaysian Islamic banking industry. The platform facilitates direct investment by investors in viable projects just like other fintech platforms such as Peer-to-peer lending. IAP provides an innovative avenue for Islamic banks’ customers to earn higher investment returns with competitive tax incentives. The key difference between IAP and other technology-based fund-raising platforms lies in the intermediation roles played by the Islamic banks. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Umar A.

Financial intermediation based only on interest-rate mechanisms has obvious limitations as it hampers both investments and employment. The chapter shows that fintech-led financial intermediation would lead to better Shari‘ah compliance and address the issue of financial inclusion as well as better financing of small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) who have hitherto been unable to access mainstream financial market. Fintech is resolving both these issues of moral hazard and information asymmetry. Fintech-led newer marketplaces, like crowdfunding platforms, have enabled an opportunity and an access to capital to businesses/projects, especially the SMEs which would have been unable to do so in the traditional banking, are driven financial intermediation.

Although many researchers and practitioners believe that Fintech can reshape the future of the financial services industry, others are skeptical about the adoption of Fintech because of the considerable risks involved. Therefore, we need to better understand why users are willing or hesitant to adopt Fintech, wherein, positive and negative factors affect their adoption decision. Based on the net valence framework theoretically embedded in theory of reasoned action, we propose a benefit-risk framework which integrates positive and negative factors associated with its adoption. Based on the empirical data collected from 244 Fintech users, this study initially investigates whether perceived benefit and risk significantly impact Fintech adoption intention. We then examine whether the effect of perceived benefit and risk on Fintech adoption intention differs depending on the user types. Results show that legal risk has the biggest negative effect, whereas convenience has the strongest positive effect on Fintech adoption intention. The differences between early adopters and late adopters are driven by different factors. © 2018 IEEE Computer Society.

Our case study presents an example of an Australian FinTech organisation, which has successfully applied Extreme Programming method as their company-wide risk management strategy tool. The Agile methods application encompasses the different layers of risk management; method, people and process. This study discusses how Agile development method practices are utilised to respond to risks and to ensure compliance. The case organisation is shown to address both the regulatory requirements as well as fulfil the bases for risk management approach and tailoring frameworks proposed in the literature. Finally, we present a theory of strategic risk management via Agile methods. This theory illustrates how method application influences other aspects of strategic risk management. © 2018 Association for Information Systems.

The digital revolution in financial services is under way, and digital disruption has the potential to shrink the role and relevance of today’s banks, while simultaneously creating better, faster, cheaper services that will be an essential part of everyday life. This forward-looking book discusses the crucial innovation, structural and institutional development for financial technologies (fintech) in Islamic finance. The authors explain concepts in fintech and blockchain technology and follow through with their applications, challenges and evolving nature. The book provides insights into technology which will enable and enhance actual prescribed Islamic behaviors in modern economic transactions. Case studies highlight how to cope with modern transactional behavior with the advent of global online/mobile markets, shorter attention spans, and impersonal trade exchange. © 2019 Hazik Mohamed and Hassnian Ali.","Blockchain; Fintech; Islamic economics; Islamic finance; Shari’ah","","","","","","","","Aldridge, Irene, Real-Time Risk: What Investors Should Know About FinTech, High-Frequency Trading, and Flash Crashes, pp. 1-212, (2017); Knowledge Management in Digital Change New Findings and Practical Cases, (2018); Boland, Richard J., Wakes of innovation in project networks: The case of digital 3-D representations in architecture, engineering, and construction, Organization Science, 18, 4, pp. 631-647, (2007); Journal of Financial Transformation, (2016); Racing from Digital Engagement to Customer Intimacy, (2016); Digital Transformation in Banking and Financial Services, (2018); Liere-Netheler, Kirsten, Drivers of digital transformation in manufacturing, Proceedings of the Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 2018-January, pp. 3926-3935, (2018); Journal of Service Management Research, (2018); Micic, Ljubisa S., Digital Transformation and Its Influence on GDP, ECONOMICS - Innovative and Economics Research Journal, 5, 2, pp. 135-147, (2017); Digital Transformation in Financial Services, (2017)","","","De Gruyter","","","","","","","9781547400966; 9781547417124","","","English","Blockchain, Fintech, and Islamic Finance: Building the Future in the New Islamic Digital Economy","Book","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083896474"

Fin-tech itself can be described as an industry composed of companies using a new tech-nology and innovation with available resources in order to compete in the marketplace of tradi-tional financial institutions and intermediaries in the delivery of financial services. In Indonesia, Fin-tech has been widely developed since the past 3 years. Fin-tech faces a new challenge as a new service for financial consumer which adapts to new ways of living in modern digital tech-nology era. Basically, Fin-tech offers three main categories such as payment, personal finance, and financing. In financing application there are peer to peer financing, social crowd funding, and loan marketplace. All of these kinds of application have some issues in legal framework and data protection due to the use of communication technologies such as internet, social networks, Smartphone, massive use of data with the Big Data, connected objects, etc. The use of big data and those new technologies create new opportunities for these sectors, and this development also raises significant data protection concerns. This paper discusses two legal issues of Fin-tech, the legal aspect, and the data protection. © 2018 Sriwijaya University.

In order to realize a cashless society, each country adopts mobile payment method as its main policy objective. It is actively promoting regulations and alleviating regulations. This is a very important task. Since the mobile easy payment services are still in the infancy phase, it is being investigated that the acceptance rate among the layers is various. Through previous researches, it was confirmed that the most important factor affecting the intention of using mobile easy payment service was perceived usefulness, and the factors influencing perceived usefulness were classified as personal characteristics, service characteristics, environmental characteristics and service characteristics. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether people with experience using mobile easy payment service will continue to use the service in the future and what factors influence the intention to use the service continuously. The results of the study showed that the variables of personal characteristics and service characteristics influenced the intention to use continuously in the future through perceived usefulness. In addition, it has been found that the various gaps between the layers are important factors in the future intention of mobile payment service. According to the results of this study, the important national task in spreading mobile payment service is suggesting that how to resolve the smart divide and the income gap is an important policy task. © 2018 SERSC Australia.","FinTech; Income divide; Mobile easy payment service; Smart divide; TAM","","","","","","","","Davis, Fred D., Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and user acceptance of information technology, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 13, 3, pp. 319-339, (1989); Diffusion of Innovations, (1995); Bandura, Albert, Self-efficacy: Toward a unifying theory of behavioral change, Psychological Review, 84, 2, pp. 191-215, (1977); Thompson, Ronald L., Personal computing: Toward a conceptual model of utilization, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 15, 1, pp. 125-142, (1991); Pham, Thanh Thao T., The effects of product-related, personal-related factors and attractiveness of alternatives on consumer adoption of NFC-based mobile payments, Technology in Society, 43, pp. 159-172, (2015); Journal of Marketing Research, (1981); Multivariate Data Analysis, (1998); Davis, Fred D., User acceptance of information technology: system characteristics, user perceptions and behavioral impacts, International Journal of Man-Machine Studies, 38, 3, pp. 475-487, (1993); Asia Pacific Journal of Convergent Research Interchange, (2015); Asiapacific Journal of Convergent Research Interchange Hsst, (2015)","K.S.

The endowment appears to be a direct translation from equivalent documents to be found in the Islamic world at the time. Islamic finance was too niche for them to deploy precious legal and compliance personnel at a time of increased regulatory scrutiny. International banks that once operated dedicated Islamic finance teams have substantially disbanded those teams. Fintech has the advantage of democratising the provision of finance, disrupting the standard business models of banks and allowing for risk-sharing asset classes to emerge, all three of which are lacking in the present-day model of Islamic banking. Fintech platforms are often able to short-circuit the challenges of contract standardisation and therefore, by association, that of Shari‘ah compliance faced by banks. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Umar A.

In order to enhance the market efficiency and liquidity, the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) has granted Thai stock brokers permission to develop and offer their customers algorithm and automatic stock trading. However, algorithm trading on SET was not widely adopted. This chapter intends to design and empirically estimate a model in explaining Thai investors’ acceptance of algorithm trading. The theoretical framework is based on the theory of reasoned action and technology acceptance model (TAM). A sample of 400 investors who have used online stock trading and 300 investors who have used algorithm stock trading were observed and analyzed using structural equations model (SEM) and generalized linear regression model (GLM) with a Logit specification. The results confirm that attitudes, subjective norm, perceived risks, and trust toward algorithm stock trading are factors determining investors’ behavior and acceptance of using algorithm stock trading. Investor’s perception and trust on algorithm stock trading as a trading strategy is a major factor in determining their perceived behavior and control, which affect their decision on whether to invest using algorithm trading. Accordingly, it can be concluded that Thai investors is willing to accept algorithm trading as a new financial technology, but still has concern about the reliability and profitable of this new stock trading strategy. Therefore, algorithm trading can be promoted by building inves-tors’ trust on algorithm trading as a reliable and profitable trading strategy. © 2018 by Emerald Publishing Limited.

It identifies FinTech’s evolution in Asia across Deposits & lending, Capital Raising, Investment Management, Market provisioning, Payments, and Insurance. This technology revolution allows us to have a banking system based on values that serve customers better, reduce risk to the society and improve returns for the shareholders. Data on unbanked population, smartphone penetration, and Internet penetration has led to retail side innovations such as Mobile Wallets, P2P Payments, and Real-time Payments in the most of Asia (except China). A total of 49% of Global Investments in FinTech are in Asia and the Chinese dragon alone accounts for 46%. India is witnessing a strong amount of FinTech deals in 2017 and it is being driven by payment and lending solutions. ASEAN FinTech industry is dominated by m-wallets and online payments; this is followed by retail investment and financial comparison. The chapter dives into the challenges Asian banks are facing because of this disruption. Now more than ever, is the important role governments and central banks of each nation play to assess the path these start-ups are headed on and this will unfold the landscape of banking in Asia a few years down the lane. © 2018 by Emerald Publishing Limited.

Promotion of the digital economy in the financial sector is a high-priority task for the short-term perspective. Nicholas Negroponte, an American scientist, first used the concept of “digital economy” in 1995. Since then, this concept has started spreading rapidly with the help of the Internet and has enhanced exchange and storage of information, complex calculations, and computer modeling of engineering facilities. In the new economy, digital platforms are the most open electronic platforms that allow receiving full information about financial institutions and organizations; they are also being developed primarily for the financial sector. The introduction of digital technologies can lead to the reduction of headcount of financial institutions.

The paper describes features and characteristics of contemporary Russian fintech landscape and ecosystem. The examples of innovative financial services in Russia, including online banking and accounting, new payments and transfers services, platforms for crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending, blockchain initiatives, etc. are discussed. It is shown that fintech initiatives have not yet led to a radical transformation of the financial sector in Russia because participants of the fintech ecosystem have different points of view on fintech. Russian banks are now developing fintech initiatives within themselves, encouraging technology companies and fintech startups to focus their efforts on innovations that are aimed at improving processes, rather than opening new markets. The Government directs the main efforts to initiatives related to regulation of cryptocurrencies circulation and to introduction of blockchain in regtech and cybersecurity. Customers are interested in new and more convenient functionality in mobile applications, and they are waiting for new value propositions, including fast international money transfers, roboadvising, personal financial management, peer-to-peer lending. © 2018 Vladimir I.

At the same time, the existing regulatory mechanisms and legislation do not create optimal conditions for the development of the market of new financial instruments and technologies in Russia today. There are socio-economic risks, the key ones including an increase in the outflow of capital and innovative projects to other countries, a lack of confidence on the part of potential investors in new financial instruments, a decrease in the stability of traditional financial institutions. On this basis, the following tasks have been set in this article. To consider the terminology in the field of digital economy from the theoretical aspect; to identify trends and justify the need for digitalization of economic processes based on the use of new financial technologies; to reveal the informative characteristics of financial technologies promising for Russia.

The disruption is in the form of loan distribution and profits gained by incumbent firms' business. This study is a pioneer study investigating the impact of fintech startups on incumbent firms' performance. Incumbent firms involved in this study are rural bank, commercial bank, and multi-finance institutions which principally run peer-to-peer lending business. Loan distribution was assessed by employing net loan to assets while profit was assessed by employing return on assets. This study was conducted in Indonesia by involving all incumbent firms registered in Indonesia Stock Exchange and Financial Service Authority. This study employed paired sample t-test to examine if net loans to assets and return on assets received differences before and after fintech startup emerged. The study reveals that fintech startup disrupts incumbent firms' business because incumbent firms' total of net loans to assets and total of return on assets decrease. However, this condition only occurs in rural bank and multi-finance institutions. Business threat of fintech startup does not occur in commercial bank. © © 2018 International Business Information Management Association (IBIMA).","Fintech; Incumbent firm; Performance; Startup","Information management; Profitability; Reactor startup; Financial service authorities; Fintech; Firms' performance; Incumbent firm; Paired-sample t-test; Peer-to-peer lending; Performance; Technology start-up; Finance","","","","","","","Ács, Zoltán J., Introduction: The startup process, Estudios de Economia, 35, 2, pp. 121-132, (2008); Alt, Rainer, The rise of customer-oriented banking - Electronic markets are paving the way for change in the financial industry, Electronic Markets, 22, 4, pp. 203-215, (2012); Georgetown Journal of International Law, (2015); Buchak, Greg, Fintech, regulatory arbitrage, and the rise of shadow banks, Journal of Financial Economics, 130, 3, pp. 453-483, (2018); Journal of Financial Transformation, (2016); Innovator S Dilemma When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail, (1997); Harvard Business Review, (2015); Chishti, Susanne, How peer to peer lending and crowdfunding drive the fintech revolution in the UK, New Economic Windows, pp. 55-68, (2016); Cramer, Judd N.L., Disruptive change in the taxi business: The case of uber, American Economic Review, 106, 5, pp. 177-182, (2016); International Journal of Economics Commerce and Management, (2017)","A.

The preliminary results suggest that professionals with financial job title or work experiences in finance industry are more likely to switch to a FinTech job. Meanwhile, the finance or computing major also has a positive effect on switching to a FinTech job. Further analysis shows that FinTech professionals in FinTech startups and FinTech incumbent firms exhibit significant different human capital characteristics, which indicates that startups put more attention to IT workers's leadership and prior startup experience while FinTech incumbent firms focus more on IT techniques and IT educational background when hiring employees. More interestingly, both of the FinTech startups and incumbent firms prefer hiring professionals with either specialized finance or computing background rather than those with both financial and computing backgrounds. Our findings are expected to have important implications for both researchers and practitioners. © International Conference on Information Systems 2018, ICIS 2018.All rights reserved.","FinTech incumbent firm; FinTech job; FinTech startup; IT professional; LinkedIn","Employment; Information systems; Information use; Personnel training; Social networking (online); Computing majors; Education training; Finance industries; FinTech incumbent firm; FinTech job; Information technology professionals; IT professional; LinkedIn; Finance","","","","","","","Ahlers, Gerrit K.C., Signaling in Equity Crowdfunding, Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, 39, 4, pp. 955-980, (2015); Belleflamme, Paul, Crowdfunding: Tapping the right crowd, Journal of Business Venturing, 29, 5, pp. 585-609, (2014); Fintech Regulatory Arbitrage and the Rise of Shadow Banks, (2017); Dencker, John C., Individual and opportunity factors influencing job creation in new firms, Academy of Management Journal, 52, 6, pp. 1125-1147, (2009); Journal of Information Systems Education, (2008); Gallagher, Kevin P., The requisite variety of skills for IT professionals, Communications of the ACM, 53, 6, pp. 144-148, (2010); Gallivan, Michael J., Examining IT Professionals’ Adaptation to Technological Change: The Influence of Gender and Personal Attributes, Data Base for Advances in Information Systems, 35, 3, pp. 28-49, (2004); Ge, Chunmian, Engineer/scientist careers: Patents, online profiles, and misclassification bias, Strategic Management Journal, 37, 1, pp. 232-253, (2016); Gomber, Peter, Digital Finance and FinTech: current research and future research directions, Journal of Business Economics, 87, 5, pp. 537-580, (2017); Huang, Allen H., Analyst information discovery and interpretation roles: A topic modeling approach, Management Science, 64, 6, pp. 2833-2855, (2018)","","","Association for Information Systems publications@aisnet.org","Auburn University; et al.; Georgia State University, J.

The expansion of FinTech industry has encouraged the use of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. A study has been conducted to assess the blockchain, cryptocurrency and FinTech market growth. This paper provides empirical evidence on the factors influencing the market growth in Malaysia and highlights the factors that could spur and hinder its future use. A survey of 304 blockchain users and industry players in Malaysia was conducted and quantitative results revealed that privacy is the most significant barrier to the adoption of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency ecosystem. Other barriers include those related to legality, cost, security, and stability, as well as difficulties in switching to a new technology. Thus, government regulation is needed to provide guidelines for ensuring the sustainability and growth of this technology in the near future. In addition, results demonstrate that the banking sector is going to be the most affected by the FinTech industry. This current trend may assist the decision makers in evaluating the potential usage of this technology, allowing them to make strategic decisions to improve business and services. © 2018, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

New financial technologies have already attracted many investors and form millions of budgets. Changing the traditional financial services concept, FinTech companies formed a new niche within the financial services market, the dynamic development of which determines the relevance of the development and implementation of an effective regulatory and oversight system. The purpose of the article is to develop an economic and mathematical model for forecasting the development of the FinTech market on the example of Ukraine. In order to study the development of the FinTech industry, a multiple regression model was presented. The model describes the dependence of the total investment value of FinTech from venture investments in financial technology, venture investments in other technologies and venture investments in online lending. Based on this model, the effect of attracting investments with new FinTech projects on the total volume of investments in the industry was clarified. According to the model, with a change in investments in FinTech by 1%, the total rate of venture investments decreases by 0.03, funds in new projects of other companies grow by 0.05, and venture investments in online lending increase by 0.89. According to the analysis of regulatory legislation in the foreign countries of the FinTech services sphere, it was found that the regulation of most of the risks associated with the development of FinTech services falls within the competence of different supervisory authorities, requiring cross-sectoral cooperation between public institutions. © Limited Liability Company","Digital finance; Financial services market; Financial supervision; Financial technologies; FinTech; InsurTech; Investment","","","","","","","","Real Estate Market in Armenia, (2018); Global Charts; Vision 2020 for Fintech and Non Bank Regulation, (2017); Marketplace Lending Fintech in Consumer and Small Business Lending, (2018); Insurthech Entering Its Second Wave, (2018); Armenian ICT Sector Enterprise Incubator Foundation, (2017); Future of Fintech and Financial Services, (2018); Global Insurance M A Themes, (2017); undefined; Supervisory Insight, (2015)","","","LLC CPC Business Perspectives","","","","","","18142427","","","","English","Innov.

However, a better understanding of these types and roles is required for incumbent as well as for new actors for defining and aligning their strategies. In this paper, we analyze the business models of 195 fintech companies with a special focus on the role of data. Based on this analysis, we present a structured overview of fintechs’ business areas as well as six data-related business model types.

The paper identifies disruptive challenges for financial institutions need to adapt. The research investigates the value and the investment flows structure as most obvious indicators of FinTech and describes types of payments relationships there. The paper considers relationships between enterprises, financial institutions and individuals, which are formed in digital payments. To understand the difference between regular cross-border money transfers and P2P crossborder money transfers with TransferWise, both mechanisms were researched and the benefits underlined. For Ukraine, the improvement of existing cross-border payments system with FinTech is a crucial challenge. That is why it is important to focus on providing knowledge for people, supporting start-ups in the sector and learning the best implementation practices. A great example of cross-border payments of FinTech in Ukraine is TransferWise. The difference between regular cross-border money transfers and peer-to-peer (P2P) money transfers appears in its benefits, such as lower and more expectable transfer fee, mid-market exchange rate, less transaction period. By transforming existing cost structures and mitigating market imperfections, they provide innovative services that meet the users' needs for speed, trust, low cost, usability, security and transparency. The results show high potential of FinTech for cross-border payment processing. © Yuriy Petrushenko.","Digital economy; Financial innovations; Financial services; Financial sphere; Financial technologies; Payment methods; Start-up; Venture","","","","","","","","Top 10 Trends in Financial Services, (2017); Evolution of Fintech A New Post Crisis Paradigm, (2015); undefined, (2018); Innovation in Payments the Future is Fintech, (2015); World Fintech Report, (2017); Top 10 Trends in Banking, (2017); Blockchain Services and Solutions Comprehensive Offerings to Guide Your Blockchain Journey, (2016); Fintech and Financial Services Initial Considerations, (2017); Ecb to Develop A Service for the Settlement of Instant Payments, (2018); Payment Services Psd 2 Directive Eu 2015 2366, (2017)","","","LLC CPC Business Perspectives","","","","","","18104967","","","","English","Investm.

Hence, it is the task of this book to shed light on the introduction and trends in FinTech, blockchain and token sales. Richly illustrated with original lecture slides taught by the authors, Inclusive FinTech: Blockchain, Cryptocurrency and ICO hopes to dispel the many misconceptions about blockchain and cryptocurrencies (especially bitcoin, Initial Crypto-Token Offering or ICO), as well as the idea that businesses can be sustainable without a social dimension going forward. With comprehensive coverage given to the FinTech scene in Asia, it is targeted at those who are searching for business opportunities.

In particular, some typical examples of applying blockchain in Financial Technology (FinTech) are discussed, including such as applying Bitcoin to drive various new business services, and implementing smart contracts based on blockchain technology to oversee the execution of legal transactions in real time. In addition, a pioneer effort of building up a distributed-ledger consortium model is addressed in the near future work. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.","","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Bitcoin; Business agreement; Business Process; Business service; Financial services industries; ITS applications; Real time; Smart contracts; Blockchain","","","","","","","Merkle, Ralph C., A digital signature based on a conventional encryption function, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 293 LNCS, pp. 369-378, (1988); Consulted, (2008); Economist, (2001); Beyond the Buzz Exploring Distributed Ledger Technology Use Cases in Capital Markets and Corporate Banking; Taylor, Michael Bedford, The evolution of bitcoin hardware, Computer, 50, 9, pp. 58-66, (2017); Magazzeni, Daniele, Validation and verification of smart contracts: A research agenda, Computer, 50, 9, pp. 50-57, (2017); Khan, Chris, A Distributed-Ledger Consortium Model for Collaborative Innovation, Computer, 50, 9, pp. 29-37, (2017); undefined; Torproject; Bitcoin and the Ppp Puzzle","W.

Examples include internet banking, mobile payments, crowdfunding, robo-advice and virtual currencies. These applications show that the digital revolution is irreversibly changing the way people live, including the way they interact with the financial system. The rapidly growing FinTech sector has its rewards and challenges (e.g. data and consumer protection issues, risk of exacerbating financial volatility and cybercrime) and has been increasingly attracting political attention at the supranational level. Thus, the fundamental question of this paper is: how is the European Union dealing with FinTech? Due to the broad scope of FinTech, EU regulators face a dilemma: on the one hand, rule-based regulatory frameworks set out compliance obligations clearly, but these are often expensive from a start-up perspective and could be an obstacle to innovation and job creation. On the other hand, principle-based regulation is more flexible, but could create some uncertainty as to what exactly is expected in terms of compliance. A possible middle ground could be found by evolving towards a more dialectic supervisory model. © 2018 Fondazione Gerardo Capriglione Onlus.

So-called ‘Fintech disruptors’ are aggressively tapping into their service delivery chain to offer clients a better (cheaper, more convenient or efficient) value proposition. As banks have subsequently been forced to think more strategically about how to conduct themselves due to the imminent use of, for example, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, biometrics and big data, regulators have simultaneously had to ensure that the pervasiveness of technological disruption does not threaten the soundness of banks and the stability of economies. Aim: To identify the strategic implications of Fintech on South African retail banks. Setting: The study is conducted in the South African retail banking industry. Methods: A post-positivist paradigm approach that is qualitative in nature. Results: There are several main findings: firstly, technology-based skills are becoming mandatory for staff and regulators alike; secondly, interaction policy is migrating clients towards a remote-based distribution strategy; thirdly, the bank of the future will not rely as heavily on brick-and-mortar branches as it has in the past; fourthly, new competitors are entering the fray and offer competitive digital-only solutions; finally, given the innovation and growth shown by these disruptors, financial sector regulators will have to find ways to hold them accountable. Conclusion: By adapting to the Fintech revolution, South African retail banks are hoping to become strategically pre-emptive rather than merely proactive. This will allow them not only to identify opportunities first, but also to offer solutions before competitors are able to do either of these. © 2018.

Part of the disadvantaged and low-income segments of global population is left without (i.e. financially excluded) or very limited access (i.e. financially underserved) to basic financial services, creating a highly critical equality deficit in different parts of the world. In this frame of reference, financial exclusion still remains a highly critical problem that hinders developing regions around the world from eradicating poverty leading to large-scale starvation and civil unrest. Moreover, financial exclusion is interwoven with social dependency making financially excluded/underserved populations strongly dependable on their social networks. The emergence of FinTech, the new breed between financial innovation and financial technology, which has been challenging the prevailing position of incumbent financial institutions, is providing a promising vehicle of tackling this phenomenon by closing the gap between unbanked, under-banked and developed societies, opening the door to the global digital economy, bringing a long-term societal transformational change for the financially excluded/underserved, while leading to inclusive economic growth helping move towards a more just and equitable society. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In the meantime, the digital finance boom has created serious concerns and challenges for Chinese regulators in relation to issues such as financial stability, consumer protection, illegal financial activities, etc. To address these issues, the Chinese government has committed to develop a comprehensive framework for the regulation and supervision of DFS and has taken a balanced approach whereby the promotion of DFS will continue under such a framework so as to ensure the sustainable development of DFS.

As new platforms and technologies are introduced to the market, and the boundaries of traditional business models are challenged, financial services can be provided with greater accountability, efficiency and accessibility. Ant Financial, China's largest Fintech company in the making, is set to revolutionize the China's financial network, including payment, wealth management and loans. It focuses on the underserved markets by the major Chinese banks: the low-income individuals, especially those in the rural areas. Ant Financial has leveraged on Taobao's platform, along with Alibaba's rural Taobao Strategy, to give out loans and help traditional agricultural business to set up shops on Taobao. Alibaba also introduced Taobao rural service centers, where villagers can get accustomed to making purchases and paying bills online, as well as picking up items they bought on Taobao. Alibaba provides computers and trains villagers to serve as its representatives in the centers, which are often in convenience stores. With Fintech advancements, access to products and financial services is becoming more accessible than ever. Ensuring a level playing field for consumers that live in rural locations or regions without the structures of an urban economy is vital in achieving full financial and social inclusion. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This article defines SocialTech as organizations that represent the intersection between Social Enterprises and Fintech. As Fintech's classifications exclude the social dimension and categorizations of social entrepreneurship activities exclude the dimension of technology, we propose a SocialTech classification that considers both technological aspects and social entrepreneurship activity.

As the battle over the Chinese mobile wallet market wages on, the gap between leading players WeChat Pay (owned by Tencent) and Alipay remains narrow. Based on brand equity theory and symbolic value theory, a research model is proposed to investigate the relationship between Fintech's technology leadership, brand equity, and customer loyalty. The results show that Alipay provides more innovative and diversified financial services and outperforms WeChat Pay in technology leadership. The study confirms that technology leadership positively affects brand equity, which in turn positively affects customer loyalty. The boundary condition for different type of customers is considered and implications for theory and practice are also discussed. © 2018 Association for Information Systems.

The authors defined the main features of FinTech platforms underlining types of FinTech, its participants and the most influential factors. The main trends of FinTech platforms development in the EU countries, such as the level of investment, impact of EU FinTech platforms on the global scale, features of investments into B2B FinTech, were determined. It was considered that in Ukraine, some positive changes in legislation were adopted, but the challenges like lack of finance, slow adoption of innovations in the financial market, not sufficient clarity of legislation remain among the main constraints for further development of FinTech platforms in Ukraine. The conducted analysis on the level of FinTech types performance by Ukrainian platforms showed only the great share of digital payments and money transfers, while other modern innovative FinTech instruments should not be underestimated for proper FinTech application in Ukraine. For this purpose, the authors have developed the Information Platform on Support for SMEs’ Innovations that consolidates interests of both SMEs and scientists. To determine both the SMEs’ opinion about the necessity of a particular Internet platform for them and the types of services that could be provided by the sme-sci.com platform, the authors conducted a survey in which 374 medium-sized and 380 small businesses took part. The results of the survey that are presented in the article confirm the necessity of the Information Platform on Support for SMEs’ Innovations and demand for it from the SMEs. Finally, the result of the research proves that such a unique informational platform as sme-sci. com that will serve as an interactive field for exchanging ideas and information of both representatives of scientific and business world is of great importance. © Alla Ivashchenko, Igor Britchenko, Mykhailo Dyba, Yevheniia Polishchuk, Yuliia Sybirianska, Yurii Vasylyshen, 2018","Crowdfunding; Equity funding; FinTech platforms; Information platforms; New technologies; P2P lending","","","","","","Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine, MESU","As a result of implementation of the young scholars’ research project “The new paradigm of financial support of innovations in small and medium enterprises” (it is funded by the Ministry of Science of Ukraine), the Information Platform on Support for SME Innovation (sme-sci.com) was developed.

The proposed genetic model transmits information to future generations in the network weights rather than the neurons. The innovative genetic algorithm is implanted in a complex deep learning structure that emulates the human brain: Reinforcement Learning takes fast local current decisions, Deep Learning Clusters provide identity and memory, Deep Learning Management Clusters take final strategic decisions and finally Genetic Learning transmits the information learned to future generations. This proposed structure has been applied and validated in Fintech; a Smart Investment application: an Intelligent Banker that performs Buy and Sell decisions on several Assets with an associated market and risk.

This consequently puts the financial services industry under additional pressure and constant growing competition from the financial sector participants, from large technology companies such as Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, from large FinTech companies such as PayPal, Moven, TransferWise, mobile network operators and other existing and potential market players. The implementation of the new EU Payment Service Directive (PSD2), which allows non-financial companies to provide access to financial services for bank customers, is expected to disrupt the financial services industry as we know it, and make traditional financial services providers and banks, in particular, think of new creative business models to remain competitive. In the process of doing this, changing the landscape of payments and creating new risks for banking business. With this study we aim to assess the new EU Payment Service regulation in the context of industry competitiveness. The study is based on the examination of the PSD2 Directive exploring the opportunities as well as the risks that it will bring to this industry in the near future, and the possibilities of cooperation of the financial services industry with financial technology developers. Moreover, we analyse structured data, collected from a questionnaire based on 4 themes of perception of techs on the importance they have on ensuring competitiveness, conducted with European tech companies. Most of the questionnaire participants believe that the Payment Services Directive 2 will promote competitiveness, innovations and development. Moreover, findings show that comparativeness is related mainly to low costs and customer satisfaction. However, it is also shown that high quality of products/services as well as relatively high speed of transactions and security, privacy and risk are also perceived as important. © 2018 International Strategic Management Association.

The empirical study is based on the analysis of the information reported by companies included in two FinTech top-list. Thus, the sample includes 91 businesses from Europe, Asia and North America. The results of the indices indicate that the total volume of information provided on the website is less than the amount reported in other sectors and other type of businesses.

Yet unlike in other digital arenas in which American companies are global leaders, such as search engines and ride hailing, the United States lags in consumer financial technology. This Article posits that the current competition policy framework is holding back consumer financial innovation. It then identifies a contributor missing from the literature: the institutional design of federal regulators. Competition authority-including antitrust and the extension of business licenses-is spread across at least five agencies. Each is focused on other missions or industries. The Department of Justice (DOJ), hindered by statutes and knowledge gaps, devotes significantly fewer resources to banking than to other industries in merger review because it leans heavily on prudential regulators. The Federal Reserve and other prudential regulators prioritize financial stability, which conflicts with their competition mandate. No agency has the right authority, motivation, and expertise to promote consumer financial competition. Innovation has raised the stakes for fixing this structural flaw in finance, and potentially in other heavily regulated industries. If allowed to compete fully, financial technology challengers (""fintechs"") could bring large consumer welfare advances and reduce the size of ""Too Big to Fail"" banks, thereby lessening the chances of a financial crisis. If allowed to grow unchecked, fintechs or the big banks acquiring them may reach the kind of digital market dominance seen in Google, Facebook, and Amazon, thereby increasing systemic risk. Whether the goal is to benefit consumers, strengthen markets, or prevent crises, a reallocation of competition authority would better position regulators to navigate the future of innovation. © 2018 American Statistical Association.

The advancement of mobile devices and their usage have increased the uptake of financial technology (FinTech) innovation. Financial sectors and startups see FinTech as a gateway to increase business opportunities, but mobile applications and other technology platforms must be launched to explore such opportunities. Mobile application security threats have increased tremendously and have become a challenge for both users and FinTech innovators. In this paper, the authors empirically inspect the components that influence the expectations of both users and organizations to adopt FinTech, such as customer trust, data security, value added, user interface design and FinTech promotion. The empirical results definitely confirm that data security, customer trust and the user design interface affect the adoption of FinTech. Existing studies have used the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to address this issue. The outcomes of this study can be used to improve the performance of FinTech strategies and enable banks to achieve economies of scale for global intensity. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the authors empirically consider factors that influence the expectations of both users and organizations in adopting FinTech, such as customer trust, data security, value added, the user design interface and FinTech promotion. The results confirm that customer trust, data security and the user design interface affect the adoption of FinTech. This research proposes a model called “Intention to adopt FinTech in Germany,” constructs of which were developed based on the TAM and five additional components, as identified. The outcomes of this study can be used to improve the performance of FinTech strategies and enable banks to achieve economies of scale for global intensity. Findings: The authors demonstrated that the number of mobile users in Germany is rapidly increasing; yet the adoption of FinTech is extremely sluggish. It is intriguing to reckon that 99 per cent of respondents had mobile devices, but only 10 per cent recognized FinTech. Further, it is significantly discouraging to perceive that only 10 of the 209 respondents had ever used FinTech services, representing under 1 per cent of the surveyed respondents. It is obvious that the FinTech incubators and banks offering FinTech services need to persuade their customers regarding the usefulness and value added advantages of FinTech. This study has been carried out to determine the key factors that influence and provoke FinTech adoption. Research limitations/implications: There are a few limitations in this study. Initially, this study focuses on FinTech implementation in Germany and not the whole of Europe. In addition, demographic and regional factors could be consolidated to inspect their particular impact on the intention to use FinTech services, particularly among younger users with a high interest in technology. Without these constraints, the authors could have gathered additional data for a more robust result and obtained new knowledge to further upgrade polices to enhance the FinTech adoption process. Future analysts can assist exploration of this topic by altering determinants in the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology model. Additionally, because the cluster sampling technique was used, the reported outcomes are not 100 per cent generalized to the German population. To accomplish a complete generalization, a basic random sampling strategy for the whole population is essential. The authors could also alleviate some limitations by examining how online vendors are performing with regard to FinTech to satisfy the needs of customers via case studies. Practical implications: This study was conducted in Germany and might have produced different results if held in other countries, as technology acceptance is different in a different environment. For instance, the authors suspect that the results would be somewhat different, were the research to be conducted in the United Kingdom, where take-up of FinTech appears to be far greater than in Germany. Therefore, the authors’ results are only generalized for the country of Germany and not other geographical areas. Furthermore, respondents may have been influenced by past experiences about FinTech usage which might have led them to neglect to answer some questions. In spite of this, this study did not consider the influence of moderating variables such as age, education and FinTech services experience. The authors also neglected social impact and control factors, as their corresponding items disregarded the instrument dependability. Accordingly, the authors could not quantify social impact and control factors on FinTech use. Social implications: The outcomes of this study can be used to improve the performance of FinTech strategies and enable banks to accomplish economies of scale for global intensity. The authors do hope that this paper will serve to encourage FinTech innovators in their approach to FinTech and enable FinTech researchers to use past work with more prominent certainty, resulting in rigid hypothesis improvement in the future. Originality/value: A considerable amount of revenue has been invested in the information technology (IT) infrastructure of banks to enhance their performance, but investment in IT remains a substantial risk regarding the return on investment (Carlson, 2015). Most banks and financial organizations around the globe are engaging in an extreme pressure from their customers and competitors to enhance IT. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cyber security; Data security; FinTech; Information security; Mobile banking","Customer satisfaction; Economics; Finance; Investments; Mobile computing; Mobile devices; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Sales; Security of data; User interfaces; Cyber security; Design/methodology/approach; FinTech; Information technology infrastructure; Mobile application securities; Mobile bankings; Technology acceptance model; Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology; Economic and social effects","","","","","","","Ajzen, Icek, The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); Understanding Attitudes and Predicting Social Behavior, (1980); Introduction to Measurement Theory, (1979); Journal of Information Technology Management, (2009); Anderson, James C., Structural Equation Modeling in Practice: A Review and Recommended Two-Step Approach, Psychological Bulletin, 103, 3, pp. 411-423, (1988); Boyd, Bill W E, Quantitative and qualitative approaches to research in environmental management, Australasian Journal of Environmental Management, 13, 2, pp. 70-78, (2006); Trustbuilders and Trustbusters the Role of Trust Cues in Interface to E Commerce Applications, (2001); Bland, John Martin Artin, Statistics notes: Cronbach's alpha, BMJ, 314, 7080, (1997); Practice of Nursing Research Conduct Critique and Utilization, (2001); Testimony on Behalf of the Fin Servs Information Sharing Analysis Ctr Fs Isac Before the US House of Rep, (2015)","H.

The purpose of the paper is to investigate how financial services industry participants perceive the effect of digital disruption as well as to explore what strategies are being adopted by incumbents in the face of potential disruption from fintech challengers. Based on an exploratory study with stakeholders from the financial ecosystem in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), the findings show that the fintech sector is still nascent, but is likely to be disruptive in selected product and customer segments. Multiple regulatory, structural, and cultural obstacles stand in the way of fintech adoption. Incumbents’ preferred strategy to face the future disruption is the bank-fintech collaboration, which will create new value for ecosystem partners and speed up innovation. Our study adds useful insights to the body of knowledge related to disruptive innovations in general and fintech in emerging markets in particular. Specifically, the collaborative response is inconsistent with the strategies usually recommended for incumbents in disruptive innovation theory. We hypothesize that our participants’ preference for partnering can be explained in the light of the distinctive characteristics of the digital economy.

Subsequent work primarily focused on the cryptocurrency, bitcoin, because its creator, programmer Satoshi Nakamoto first published a white paper and coded what is now known as blockchain technology to solve the double spending problem. More recently, Blockchain Technology has made significant advances in the fields of insurance, medical records, and the internet of things (IoT). However, the power of Blockchain Technology to solve problems in and serve as a replacement ledger of transactions in Financial Services will fundamentally transform the finance industry. This paper attempts to address the challenges that Blockchain Technology will encounter by focusing on the methodology of using Blockchain Technology to solve problems in the Financial Services Market with special attention to the use of Decentralization and Peer-to-Peer Transactions. Specifically, this project will be examining the use of Blockchain Technology to drive the changes in the field of Financial Services. This paper will also discuss the future role of Blockchain Technology in teaching the various fields of Finance, and juxtapose them against traditional teaching methods in Finance, in order to reveal the increasing role that Blockchain Technology will play in the 21st-century Financial Services curriculum. This paper argues that indeed, Blockchain Technology will be able to increasingly affect how we solve various Financial Services problems and that this development will profoundly change the way the Finance curriculum is taught in the classroom. In conclusion, this project, by closely examining the role of Blockchain Technology, sheds new light on the rapidly developing changes in the Financial Services field. © The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology.","","","","","","","","","Can Cryptocurrencies Fulfil the Functions of Money, (2016); Will Blockchain Become the Internet of Finance, (2016); undefined; Iansiti, Marco, The truth about blockchain, Harvard Business Review, 2017, January-February, (2017); How Blockchain Technology Will Disrupt Financial Services Firms, (2016); 10 Things to Know about the Future of Blockchain in Education, (2016); Intelligence Unleashed an Argument for AI in Education, (2016); London Startup Blockchain Raises 40 Million in Fresh Funding, (2017); Promise of Blockchain the Trust Machine, (2015); Harvard Business Review, (2017)","M.H.

We examine the impact of the funding of such start-ups on the stock returns of 47 incumbent US retail banks for 2010 to 2016. Methods: To capture the importance of FinTech start-ups, we use data on both the dollar-volume of funding and number of deals. We relate these to the stock returns with panel data regression methods. Results: Our results indicate a positive relationship exists between the growth in FinTech funding or deals and the contemporaneous stock returns of incumbent retail banks. Conclusions: Although these results suggest complementarity between FinTech and traditional banking, we note that our results at the banking industry level are not statistically significant, and that the coefficient signs for about one-third of the banks are negative, but not statistically significant. Since the FinTech industry is young and our sample period short, we cannot rule out that our findings are spurious. © 2017, The Author(s).","Banks; Digital banking; Finance; FinTech; Innovation; Retail banks; Start-ups; Stock returns; Technology; Venture capital","","","","","","","","Journal of Marketing, (1990); Afuah, Allan N., Responding to structural industry changes: A technological evolution perspective, Industrial and Corporate Change, 6, 1, pp. 183-202, (1997); Benner, Mary J., The incumbent discount: Stock market categories and response to radical technological change, Academy of Management Review, 32, 3, pp. 703-720, (2007); Five Concerns with the Five Factor Model, (2016); Fintech Regulatory Arbitrage and the Rise of Shadow Banks, (2017); Harvard Business Review, (2014); Chishti, Susanne, The FinTech Book: The financial technology handbook for investors, entrepreneurs and visionaries, pp. 1-300, (2016); Innovator S Dilemma When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail, (1997); Dávila, Antonio, Venture capital financing and the growth of startup firms, Journal of Business Venturing, 18, 6, pp. 689-708, (2003); Davis, James L., Characteristics, covariances, and average returns: 1929 to 1997, Journal of Finance, 55, 1, pp. 389-406, (2000)","L.

We assess how security is treated by startups that provide disruptive technologies in the financial sector. In an area that has been committed to security, we find that FinTech companies have modern designs and outstanding user experience as their main priority. This strategy is rewarded by a rapidly increasing customer base but reveals a flawed understanding of security.We analyzed all aspects of security of N26, including the frontend, backend, protocols, human factors, and underlying design concepts, and found issues in all of them. We succeeded in leaking customer data, manipulating and carrying transactions and even could have entirely taken over foreign accounts. We reported these findings to N26 and did not disclose them before they were fixed. By publishing this case study, we hope to raise awareness about security considerations in the critical banking sector, especially for other FinTech startups. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

However, there are well known problems on the fraud detection system. One is too difficult to create an appropriate model for discovering fraud and the other is difficult to detect new types of fraud in the emerging fintech services.

Fintech companies restructure the value chain, re-bundle offerings and create new services that are to be presented and processed digitally - perhaps completely. Nevertheless, recent research with wealthy internet savvy investment customers in Germany shows that this attractive segment can be regarded as hybrid in respect of their demand for digital as well as personal asset management services and products. On the one hand wealthy internet savvy investors indicate a high level of satisfaction with advice and products from their traditional financial services partners. On the other hand they continue to search for better investment opportunities, thus showing significant demand for innovative digital banking/brokerage/advice products. Ultimately, research gives strong evidence for a high need for personal advice and human guidance. This is particularly valid when answering the question which (traditional vs. innovative) partner to choose as the future (exclusive or additional) bank, broker or financial advisor.This paper outlines the world of Fintech start-up companies, presents key findings regarding the attractive and large segment of wealthy internet savvy investors and also explores how the new Fintech conquerors as well as established banks and advisors might embrace this new business environment. © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany 2018.","","","","","","","","","Cutting Through the Noise Around Financial Technology, (2016); undefined, (2016); undefined, (2016); Management in Kreditinstituten Und Unternehmen Ein Querschnitt Aktueller Entwicklungen, (2016); Fintech 100 Leading Global Fintech Innovators Report 2015; undefined; undefined; Unicorn List Current Private Companies Valued at 1B and Above; undefined; undefined","T.

And, it is a commonly used opening phrase for tech start-up investor presentations. Being ""disruptive"" and ""innovative"" are key ingredients for such pitch decks and are inflationary buzzwords in today's venture scene. What's often left out is being visionary and having the goal to create something substantial, something that generates a positive cash flow, building a lasting and leading business. Buzz has replaced reason in so many cases and cause has been replaced with reach, which is the usually the aim of businesses, rather than creating value. When we take a look under the hood of FinTech, we can try to see whether it is actually something - or perhaps just a way of categorizing start-ups of a specific industry. And, as FinTech is very often associated with the omnipresent discussion about crypto currencies and blockchain, we'll take a look at that too. In discussions and in keynotes the word blockchain is also used as a buzzword. Everyone else seems to hop on the same train, leaving it pretty unclear what it actually means or does - what blockchain is. Hype bears the risk of blindness for the risks and limitations there might be. It appears as if everything in IT could be replaced by blockchain these days, yet it is reasonable to believe that might not be the case at all. To start off, we will take a look at how trends have developed in digital business in recent times. © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany 2018.","","","","","","","","","undefined; undefined; undefined; undefined; undefined; undefined; undefined; undefined; undefined; undefined","N.

For decades, existing benefit distribution approaches have been debated by academics, and presented challenges for conservation practitioners. In passing through long chains of project actors, payments incur high transaction costs and are susceptible to elite capture and corruption. A new type of financial technology (FinTech) – ‘mobile money’ – could offer a novel and available solution to these challenges, at what is now a critical stage in PES and REDD+ implementation. Mobile payments (made via cell phones) have been used successfully in development projects related to micro-credit, micro-insurance, and aid relief, and this commentary considers their possible advantages and drawbacks for PES/REDD+ schemes. Several countries e.g. Cambodia, China, Tanzania, and the Philippines demonstrate both high PES/REDD+ uptake, and high mobile money penetration. In certain circumstances benefit distribution via FinTech may lower transaction costs, enable higher frequency payments, and provide new socioeconomic benefits. It could also improve the privacy, transparency, traceability, and security of disbursements, contributing to more efficient and equitable PES and REDD+ schemes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Benefit sharing; Conservation; Economic incentives; Environmental services; Mobile payments; Transaction cost","","","","","","","","Adhikari, Bhim, Designing payments for ecosystem services schemes: Some considerations, Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability, 5, 1, pp. 72-77, (2013); Payment Mechanisms and Anti Poverty Programs Evidence from A Mobile Money Cash Transfer Experiment in Niger, (2014); Banerjee, Simanti, How to sell ecosystem services: A guide for designing new markets, Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, 11, 6, pp. 297-304, (2013); Transforming Our World the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, (2015); Ilo Social Protection and Inclusion Experiences and Policy Issues, (2006); Cacho, Oscar J., Transaction costs of carbon offset projects: A comparative study, Ecological Economics, 88, pp. 232-243, (2013); Calvet-Mir, L., Payments for ecosystem services in the tropics: A closer look at effectiveness and equity, Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability, 14, pp. 150-162, (2015); Carbon Clim Law Rev, (2015); Clements, Tom J., Impact of payments for environmental services and protected areas on local livelihoods and forest conservation in northern Cambodia, Conservation Biology, 29, 1, pp. 78-87, (2015); Global Findex Database 2014 Measuring Financial Inclusion Around the World, (2015)","","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09218009","","ECECE","","English","Ecol.

Authoritative settlement based on central bank support is seen as being essential for both large value and retail payment systems; and, in the EU, UK, and US, the importance of regulating for the protection of consumers who use retail payment systems is recognised. In this institutional context, payment innovations (including Bitcoin and distributed ledger or autonomous organisation technologies) are assessed. It is suggested that, while competition at certain levels is likely to bring social benefits through commercial developments, the maintenance of public interest objectives necessarily delineates the scope of competition. While this might limit the disruptive impact of payment innovations, it is argued that, in the light of the public policy needs for a stable and efficient public infrastructure and the social needs of confidence and trust in a predictable and regulated payment system that meets commercial and social expectations such as in consumer protection, this is not necessarily undesirable. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","clearing and settlement; distributed ledger technology; payment innovation; Payment Services Directive; Payment systems; virtual currency","","","","","","","","","I.H.-Y.

This evolution is characterized by expanded connectivity and enhanced speed of information processing both at the customer interface and in back-office processes. Recently, there has been a shift in the focus of digitalization from improving the delivery of traditional tasks to introducing fundamentally new business opportunities and models for financial service companies. Digital Finance encompasses a magnitude of new financial products, financial businesses, finance-related software, and novel forms of customer communication and interaction—delivered by FinTech companies and innovative financial service providers. Against this backdrop, the research on finance and information systems has started to analyze these changes and the impact of digital progress on the financial sector. Therefore, this article reviews the current state of research in Digital Finance that deals with these novel and innovative business functions. Moreover, it gives an outlook on potential future research directions. As a conceptual basis for reviewing this field, the Digital Finance Cube, which embraces three key dimensions of Digital Finance and FinTech, i.e., the respective business functions, the technologies and technological concepts applied as well as the institutions concerned, is introduced. This conceptualization supports researchers and practitioners when orientating in the field of Digital Finance, allows for the arrangement of academic research relatively to each other, and enables for the revelation of the gaps in research. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Digital Finance; e-Finance; FinTech; Future research opportunities; Literature review; State of the art","","","","","","","Funding text 1: Furthermore, research in the user behavior sub-category has analyzed what projects are selected for funding by the financial backers. For lending-based crowdfunding, lenders prefer projects of borrowers that are culturally similar and geographically proximate (Burtch et al. , ). Furthermore, the authors discover that the negative effect of cultural differences on pledging activities of lenders is decreasing for higher distances. Paravisini et al. () identified that investors show different risk aversion in their decision behavior. Although counter-intuitive, their analysis reveals that wealthier investors have a higher risk aversion and, more intuitive, that investors in crowdfunding behave in a more risk averse manner after negative wealth shocks.; Funding text 2: The authors of these papers have discovered interesting factors that support the successful collecting of money. Zvilichovsky et al. () concentrated on reciprocity in crowdfunding. They found that having helped other founders on the platform by pledging money has a positive effect on successful funding and provided evidence for direct and indirect reciprocity. Mollick () suggested that personal networks and project quality are factors that support funding success. Colombo et al. () supported that backing others (“internal social capital”) is important for funding success. They explained that this effect “is fully mediated by the capital and backers collected in the campaign’s early days”. Koch and Siering () analyzed the influence of project- and founder-specific aspects on funding success and concluded that the use of media (like texts, pictures, and videos) is an important factor supporting success. They also captured the idea of reciprocity and supported its positive influence on funding results. For equity-based crowdfunding, Ahlers et al. () argued that keeping a part of the equity instead of selling the entirety of equity has a positive influence on funding success as this is interpreted as a quality signal and proposed that detailed information about risk and the internal governance (e.g., board structure) also influence funding success.","Agrawal, Ajay K., Crowdfunding: Geography, Social Networks, and the Timing of Investment Decisions, Journal of Economics and Management Strategy, 24, 2, pp. 253-274, (2015); Ahlers, Gerrit K.C., Signaling in Equity Crowdfunding, Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, 39, 4, pp. 955-980, (2015); Allen, Franklin, E-finance: An introduction, Journal of Financial Services Research, 22, 1-2, pp. 5-27, (2002); Allison, Thomas H., Crowdfunding in a prosocial microlending environment: Examining the role of intrinsic versus extrinsic cues, Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, 39, 1, pp. 53-73, (2015); Amit, Raphael, Crafting Business Architecture: the Antecedents of Business Model Design, Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal, 9, 4, pp. 331-350, (2015); Androutsellis-Theotokis, Stephanos, A survey of peer-to-peer content distribution technologies, ACM Computing Surveys, 36, 4, pp. 335-371, (2004); Antweiler, Werner, Is all that talk just noise?

Given the scope, complexity, and dynamism of FinTech solutions, cyberattacks are inevitable, making enhanced security technology indispensable to ensuring future growth. Information leakage is one of the most common vulnerabilities and is still difficult to be prevented completely. The most promising approach to solving this problem is secure computation, which, thanks to its ability to process encrypted data, has proven to be a robust information leakage prevention technology. This paper discusses NEC's own contribution to Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) technology. In SMPC, data on multiple machines can be processed while maintaining the security of the data on each machine. In addition to explaining the technology itself, we will show how it could work in FinTech applications by reviewing some case studies centering around NEC's high-speed method and protection of information for authentication.","Authentication; Information leakage prevention; Secure computation secure multi-party computation; Security","Authentication; Security of data; Cyber security; Encrypted data; Information leakage; Multiple machine; Secure computation; Secure multi-party computation; Security; Security technology; Cryptography","","","","","","","About Macromill; Araki, Toshinori, High-throughput semi-honest secure three-party computation with an honest majority, Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, 24-28-October-2016, pp. 805-817, (2016); Eurocrypt, (2017)","","","NEC Mediaproducts","","","","","","18805884","","","","English","NEC Tech.

Endeavours towards financial inclusion of the underserved SMEs could rationalize why we should allow for or encourage FinTech innovations exemplified by the online supply-chain financing mentioned above. What would be an adaptive regulatory regime for such innovative FinTech-enabled financial services as the online supply-chain financing? Within our conceptual framework to regulate the FinTech industry at the early stage, rather than rigorous rules traditionally placed on large financial institutions, a principles-based strategy should be adopted to strike a balance between financial stability and access to financial services advanced by disruptive innovations. As a necessary complement, regulatory sandboxes would be needed to spur a shift in institutional philosophy to a principles-based regulatory regime. In other words, the regulatory attitude of FinTech regulation should be humble and light-Touch to promote innovation for improving digital financial inclusion, albeit on the premise of containing potential systemic risk and protecting consumer interest in the meantime. © Cambridge University Press and KoGuan Law School, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.","financial disintermediation; financial inclusion; financial technology; light-Touch/humble regulation; principles-based regulation; regulatory sandbox","","","","","","","","Principles of Financial Regulation, (2016); Georgetown Journal of International Law, (2015); Northwestern Journal of International Law Business, (2016); Cesifo, (2016); Oxford Handbook of Financial Regulation, (2015); Brooklyn Journal of Corporate Financial and Commercial Law, (2011); Understanding Regulation Theory Strategy and Practice, (1999); Financial Regulation Law and Policy, (2018); Fintech Building A 21st Century Regulators Toolkit, (2014); Hastings Business Law Journal, (2015)","","","Cambridge University Press Journals_subscriptions@cup.cam.ac.uk","","","","","","20529015","","","","English","Asian J.

Fintech is a new economic industry, comprised of companies that adopted the latest technologies to provide more efficient financial services than the traditional financial services. Fintech companies are generally small to medium sized startups trying to disintermediate existing financial systems. FinTech companies can be differentiated in several areas, based on its business solutions and target customers. In Korea, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending companies are the most prominent in the FinTech sector. P2P lending is a method of borrowing or lending money to individuals through online services without the use of an official financial institution as an intermediary. The P2P lending companies operate their services entirely online or mobile environment. Consequently, mobile P2P lending application users are dramatically increasing. Thus, it is worth evaluating the acceptance of the mobile apps of the P2P lending companies from a user’s perspective. This paper discusses user acceptance of the mobile P2P lending apps, guided by the Technology Acceptance Model. We conclude that the users’ acceptance of mobile P2P lending apps are significantly influenced by perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and user satisfaction. These in turn influenced their attitude towards using mobile P2P lending apps and intention to use. © 2017 KSII.","APIC-IST 2016; FinTech; P2P Lending; P2P Lending Apps; P2P Lending Platform; Social Lending","Peer to peer networks; APIC-IST 2016; Financial institution; FinTech; P2p lending; Perceived ease of use; Perceived usefulness; Social Lending; Technology acceptance model; Finance","","","","","","","Wharton Fintech, (2014); National Digital Research Centre, (2014); Alt, Rainer, The rise of customer-oriented banking - Electronic markets are paving the way for change in the financial industry, Electronic Markets, 22, 4, pp. 203-215, (2012); What is Fintech the Story of Broken Banks, (2015); Boom in Global Fintech Investment, (2014); Accenture, (2016); undefined; Landscaping Uk Fintech; A Trillion Dollar Market by the People for the People how Marketplace Lending Will Remake Banking as We Know It, (2014); Korea Economic Daily, (2015)","S.

At the same time it is challenging regulators. The key issue they face is how to balance the desire to encourage new businesses so as to intensify competition and provide better customer services in the sector, while protecting the system and consumers from excessively risky behaviour and potential disruption. For Indonesia the opportunity is very large given the uneven availability of finance and low levels of financial inclusion.

The FinTech revolution has brought massive changes to the way investing is done. Trading happens in microsecond time frames, and while risks are emerging faster and in greater volume than ever before, traditional risk management approaches are too slow to be relevant. This book describes market microstructure and modern risks, and presents a new way of thinking about risk management in today's high-speed world. Accessible, straightforward explanations shed light on little-understood topics, and expert guidance helps investors protect themselves from new threats. The discussion dissects FinTech innovation to highlight the ongoing disruption, and to establish a toolkit of approaches for analyzing flash crashes, aggressive high frequency trading, and other specific aspects of the market. Today's investors face an environment in which computers and infrastructure merge, regulations allow dozens of exchanges to coexist, and globalized business facilitates round-the-clock deals. This book shows you how to navigate today's investing environment safely and profitably, with the latest in risk-management thinking. Discover risk management that works within micro-second trading. Understand the nature and impact of real-time risk, and how to protect yourself. Learn why flash crashes happen, and how to mitigate damage in advance. Examine the FinTech disruption to established business models and practices. When technology collided with investing, the boom created stratospheric amounts of data that allows us to plumb untapped depths and discover solutions that were unimaginable 20 years ago. Real-Time Risk describes these solutions, and provides practical guidance for today's savvy investor. © 2017 by Irene Aldridge and Steve Krawciw.

We draw from the concepts of sensing and responding to analyse more than 3000 news articles, webpages, reports, and press releases covering the period 2008-2017 related to four Australian Banks. Within the limitations of the method, our findings indicate that Australian Banks are actively embracing FinTech by creating mechanisms for inbound FinTech knowledge flows, monitoring and facilitating FinTech activities of start-ups, crowd-sourcing FinTech ideas, seeting up innovation hubs to encourage internal FinTech innovations, modernizing their platforms with the adoption of technologies commonly associated with startups, partnering, and investing in FinTech start-ups.

Despite societal and regulatory challenges banks have recognised the importance of digital developments and are working intensively on potential solutions and strategies. Many (digital) innovations can primarily be experienced at the client front-end. There is, however, much more to this topic. Isolated solutions are often only implemented in a fragmented fashion from division to division. Innovation processes are still being driven forward laboriously using an outdated silo approach. Furthermore, many banks’ command of the global “language of the internet” is still deficient. The banks will not achieve resounding success using such methods. Digital change requires far-reaching structural reforms that extend beyond all internal and external bank processes and systems. The new market players from the non-bank sector, by contrast, have an almost perfect understanding of the language of the internet. First and foremost it is the scarcely regulated digital ecosystems, but there are also many fintechs that are using their platforms and ingenious “walled garden” strategies to dominate markets across a range of sectors. Their recipe for success is based on the harmonious interplay between implemented hardware and software. Via the optimum interlinking and utilisation of compatible and interoperable standards/technologies we—the platform-spoiled consumers—are courted with attractive products and services conveniently, globally and from a single source. Traditional banks could do this, too, however.

The core technologies on convergence are mobile, smart and cloud. Because of popularization and progress on mobile device and service, the various patterns related with our consumption have been changed. There are many backgrounds in emergence of FinTech industry. In this study, we studied FinTech start-up firms. FinTech refers to a newly emerging industry and service fields through the fusion of finance and ICT. In this study, we studied on current status of FinTech firms. We deal with domestic firms such as Daum Kakao, LGU+. And we described In foreign firms such as Fidor Bank, Simple Online Bank, OnDeck, Stripe and Affirm. Eventually we analyzed problems of the current FinTech firms. In this study, we described several FinTech start-up firms. Many FinTech companies are especially in the payment sector. Two rapidly growing start-ups to notice for the recent five years are studied. A biggest hurdle in electrolyzation of financial service is personal information leakage therefore, biometrics to supplement it gains attention. According to gartner, bio authentication use ratio using mobile devices is forecast to grow from current 5-30%. However, damage may continue to one's life time if bio information leaks. The argument on user's psychological anxiety and human right violation needs to be solved. e-Payment services through non-financial companies like IT companies are on the rapid rise. Competition between financial companies and non-financial companies, between IT companies to preempt the e-payment market is fierce. As the FinTech market rapidly grows associated fields are expected to grow as well. Big data and crowd markets are forecast to grow together security and bio technology markets are also projected to gain attention, since security issue works as a huge hindrance factor for the future of the FinTech markets. © Medwell Journals, 2017.","Banking; FinTech; Payment crowdfunding; Start-up; Technology","","","","","","","","Evolution of Fintech A New Post Crisis Paradigm, (2015); Chishti, Susanne, Preface, pp. viii-ix, (2016); Fintech Challenges and Opportunities how Digitization is Transforming the Financial Sector, (2016); Die Fidor Smart Community Gemeinsam Mehr Geld, (2017); Journal of Financial Perspectives, (2015); Jun, Jooyong, Entry of FinTech Firms and Competition in the Retail Payments Market, Asia-Pacific Journal of Financial Studies, 45, 2, pp. 159-184, (2016); Kauffman, Robert J., Special issue: Contemporary research on payments and cards in the global fintech revolution, Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 14, 5, pp. 261-264, (2015); Wake Forest Law Review, (2015); Schueffel, Patrick, Taming the beast: A scientific definition of fintech, Journal of Innovation Management, 4, 4, pp. 32-54, (2016); Korean Social Login for Magento 1 2, (2017)","","","Medwell Journals medwellonline@gmail.com","","","","","","1816949X","","","","English","J.

This is relentlessly projected to affect competition in some parts of the financial system and to impact its structure and dynamics, calling upon policy- and law-makers to take a close look at the financial stability implications. The aim of this paper is to develop a theoretical framework to aid supervisors, policy- and law-makers in managing risks and harnessing opportunities arising from the transition to the ""FinTech era"". Until now, ""FinTech"" has been vaguely associated with concepts like ""disruption"", ""decentralisation"" and ""disintermediation"". Very little efforts have been spent on explaining the relevance of each of them. Departing from the prevailing current, this paper deploys such concepts as filters in risk-profiling FinTech. According to our model, we identify four filters (economic function, disruptive potential, disintermediation, and decentralisation) against which to categorise ""FinTech"". The output of the filtering process is intended to facilitate the examination of questions relating to policy and regulatory responses.","","","","","","","","","Global Fintech Survey 2016; Oxford Handbook of Banking, (2014); Journal of Technology Law Policy, (2016); Walker, George Alexander, Financial technology law - A new beginning and a new future, International Lawyer, 50, 1, pp. 137-215, (2017); Fair and Effective Markets Review, (2015); Review of Banking and Financial Law, (2012); Harvard Business Law Review, (2012); Brummer, Chris J., Disruptive technology and securities regulation, Fordham Law Review, 84, 3, pp. 977-1052, (2015); Regulating the Shadow Banking System, (2010); Distributed Ledger Technology Beyond Block Chain, (2016)","","","Fondazione Gerardo Capriglione Onlus fondazionecapriglione@luiss.it","","","","","","","","","","English","Law Econ.

However, it is yet to be observed in Latvia to the same extent. This paper aims to evaluate fintech's level of development in Latvia compared to Europe. The paper identifies financial services using innovative technologies offered by fintech companies, analyses the advantages and disadvantages of these services in comparison with services offered by the traditional financial sector companies (banks, insurance companies, institutions involved in asset management and investment, etc.), and evaluates how prepared are consumers to use fintech services. This paper documents the results of the survey aiming to clarify how well-informed consumers in Latvia are about fintech services, their convenience, speed and safety, as well as the consumers' current satisfaction with banking services. The hypothesis of this paper is that Latvian society is not ready to use services provided by fintech, but prefers banking services instead. Survey results provide some evidence in favour of this hypothesis: they show that respondents are generally unaware about fintech services in Latvia and their associated innovations and new financial products. This paper makes several recommendations for managers of fintech enterprises, association of start-up enterprises and risk capital funds as well as state institutions.","Competition; Fintech; Innovation in financial services","","","","","","","","Future of Fintech and Banking Digitally Disrupted or Reimagined, (2015); Anikina, Irina D., Methodological aspects of prioritization of financial tools for stimulation of innovative activities, European Research Studies Journal, 19, 2 Special Issue, pp. 100-112, (2016); Consumers and Mobile Financial Services 2016, (2016); Consumers and Mobile Financial Services 2015, (2015); Counting the World S Unbanked, (2010); Opportuities for Mobile Financial Services to Engage Qualitative Research Findings, (2016); Fetai, Besnik Taip, Financial integration and financial development: Does financial integration matter?, European Research Studies Journal, 18, 2, pp. 97-106, (2015); Harrison, Rupert, Does innovation stimulate employment?

At current stage exchanges are mainly exploring the technology looking for proofs of concept, with the exception of some more advanced projects like at Nasdaq and ASX. The mass adoption will require longer efforts and is expected to come in a decade, at least. Fintech developments are receiving strong attention also by regulators and international organizations, given the potential of distributed ledger technology for both competition enhancement and cyber risk reduction.

Design/methodology/approach: With a literature review on the global regulatory environment and the underlying risks related to Fintech, it looks into the formulation and implementation of complementary regulatory policies in the case of Hong Kong as a GFC. Relevant policy documents disclosed by the financial regulator on cybersecurity and pertinent issues are examined. Findings: Adopting a strategic approach that seizes opportunities associated with Fintech, the financial regulator harnesses comprehensive risk-based mechanisms to embrace exposures to cyber risks while promoting institutionalization of cybersecurity among the regulated firms with strategic controls. This study suggests a pathway for the evolution of a profession with both technical and ethical competence for mitigating the emerging risks arising from Fintech. However, such an approach is yet to be tested with respect to efficacy for the unexplored territories of fraud exposures, resulting from swift Fintech developments across borders. Research limitations/implications: As Fintech has only emerged rapidly in the recent years, it is not conclusive in this review of performance and effectiveness of the financial regulator in its strategic approach. Further studies may utilize a longitudinal method to analyze and examine the regulatory measures undertaken by financial regulators in various GFCs. Originality/value: This study reveals a strategic approach adopted by an emerged GFC in embracing Fintech innovation that however brings about unidentified risks and potential frauds to its financial services sector. Pertinent anti-fraud and cybersecurity measures are highlighted. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cybersecurity; Fintech; Fraud; Global financial centre; Hong Kong; Risk-based approach","","","","","","","","Future of Fintech and Banking Digitally Disrupted or Reimagined, (2015); Fintech and the Evolving Landscape Landing Points for the Industry, (2016); Fraud Detection Using Data Analytics in the Banking Industry, (2014); Alexander, Kern, Global Governance of Financial Systems : The International Regulation of Systemic Risk, pp. 1-327, (2007); Fintech, (2016); Evolution of Fintech A New Post Crisis Paradigm, (2015); What is Fraud, (2016); Complying with Aml Laws Challenges for the Fintech Industry, (2016); First Ever Fintech Bridge Established Between Britain and Singapore, (2016); Insider Fraud, (2015)","A.W.

At the juncture of these phenomena lies regulatory technology or “RegTech”—the use of technology, particularly information technology, in the context of regulatory monitoring, reporting, and compliance. Regulating rapidly transforming financial systems requires increasing the use of and reliance on RegTech. Whilst the principal regulatory objectives (e.g., financial stability, prudential safety and soundness, consumer protection and market integrity, and market competition and development) remain, their means of application are increasingly inadequate. RegTech developments are leading towards a paradigm shift necessitating the reconceptualization of financial regulation. RegTech to date has focused on the digitization of manual reporting and compliance processes. This offers tremendous cost savings to the financial services industry and regulators. However, the potential of RegTech is far greater – it has the potential to enable a nearly real-time and proportionate regulatory regime that identifies and addresses risk while facilitating more efficient regulatory compliance. We argue that the transformative nature of technology will only be captured by a new approach at the nexus of data, digital identity, and regulation. This paper seeks to expose the inadequacy of digitizing analogue processes in a digital financial world, sets the foundation for a practical understanding of RegTech, and proposes sequenced reforms that could benefit regulators, industry, and entrepreneurs in the financial sector and other industries. © 2017.

This study aims to identify the strategic considerations in the process of searching for FinTech investment targets. Case description: This study used a case study investigation of a top-5 bank in Taiwan. The major data sources include the meeting notes of the FinTech investment task force and interviews with the team members. Co-opetition theory was adopted as the theoretical framework and interview questions were derived from the PARTS strategies in co-petition theory. The results relate to: (1) the strategic goals of FinTech investment, (2) the added value from FinTech companies, (3) criteria in selecting candidates in the same FinTech area, (4) choosing to work as either a cooperator or a competitor, and (5) barriers from policies and regulations. Discussion and evaluation: This study has several findings: (1) regulations and policies shape FinTech’s development; (2) banks, technology companies, and customers are not “FinTech ready;” (3) Compare top-down with bottom up strategies; (4) banks and FinTech companies have complex relationships; (5) it is unlikely that Taiwan will produce FinTech disruptors in the near future. Conclusion: The findings and discussion can benefit researchers and administrators in finance-related industries. More studies are desired to observe long-term development in terms of how companies collaborate or compete in specific FinTech areas. © 2016, The Author(s).","Bank 3.0; Co-opetition Theory; FinTech; Investment in FinTech; PARTS; Taiwan bank industry; Taiwan FinTech Industry","","","","","","Total","• Financial Research and Data (79 startups, 824 M total funding)","Global Fintech Investment Growth Continues in 2016 Driven by Europe and Asia, (2016); Benbasat, Izak, The case research strategy in studies of information systems, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 11, 3, pp. 369-386, (1987); Co Opetition, (1996); Cavaye, Angèle L.M., Case study research: A multi-faceted research approach for IS, Information Systems Journal, 6, 3, pp. 227-242, (1996); Econ Res, (2011); Financial Supervisory Committee Big Data Project, (2015); Construct Digital Finance Environments, (2015); Act Governing Electronic Payment Institutions, (2015); Regulations of Bank and Financial Holding Company Investing Fintech Firms, (2015); Regulations of Industry of Information Service and Industry of Finance Technology Determined by the Competent Authority as Finance Related Industry, (2015)","J.-L.

Therefore, FinTech has become a subject of debate among practitioners, investors, and researchers and is highly visible in the popular media. In this study, we unveil the drivers motivating the FinTech phenomenon perceived by the English and German popular press including the subjects discussed in the context of FinTech. This study is the first one to reflect the media perspective on the FinTech phenomenon in the research. In doing so, we extend the growing knowledge on FinTech and contribute to a common understanding in the financial and digital innovation literature. These study contributes to research in the areas of information systems, finance and interdisciplinary social sciences. Moreover, it brings value to practitioners (entrepreneurs, investors, regulators, etc.), who explore the field of FinTech. © 2016, The Author(s).","Content analysis; Digitalization; FinTech; Innovation; Popular press","","","","","","","","Bbva Research, (2015); Cukier, Wendy L., Applying Habermas' validity claims as a standard for critical discourse analysis, IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology, 143, pp. 233-257, (2004); Cukier, Wendy L., A critical analysis of media discourse on information technology: Preliminary results of a proposed method for critical discourse analysis, Information Systems Journal, 19, 2, pp. 175-196, (2009); Deutsche Bank Research, (2014); undefined, (2016); Fichman, Robert G., Digital innovation as a fundamental and powerful concept in the information systems curriculum, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 38, 2, pp. 329-353, (2014); Finkel, Jenny Rose, Incorporating non-local information into information extraction systems by Gibbs sampling, pp. 363-370, (2005); Frame, W.

The authors assume the general methodological approach of grounded theory to study four cases of financial technology platforms from Russia; the sample represents companies focusing both on solutions for the front end (consumers) and back end (middle of the value chain). The research finds that the top executives of the companies, which create and operate the digital platforms, have an approach to business strategy that is significantly different from that of the traditional business. They defy the pragmatism of predicting the market development and planning the company's actions in accordance with such predictions. Strategic paradigm of these companies is based on the notions of inclusivity, dynamism, and reliance on independent participants of a business ecosystem. Though a radical departure from the traditional business strategy, such an approach has brought demonstrable business success across the time span of a decade. The idea of “platform–ecosystem” can also be fruitful as a tool of solving important socioeconomic issues such as financial inclusion in the emerging markets. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","","","","","","","","","International Proceedings of Economics Development and Research, (2012); Harvard Business Review, (2013); Cgd Policy Paper, (2015); Statistics of National Payment System, (2015); Grounded Theory Methodology an Overview, (1994); Handbook of Qualitative Research, (1994); Academy of Management Review, (1989); Eisenhardt, Kathleen M., Theory building from cases: Opportunities and challenges, Academy of Management Journal, 50, 1, pp. 25-32, (2007); Grounded Theory Core Elements Part 1, (2010); Strategies for Qualitative Research, (1967)","O.

In this article, we report the cash-based monetary practices of one Ethiopian rural community and identify their implications for the design of new financial technology. Particularly, we focus on addressing the question, What characteristic features should go into the design of mobile money application(s) to embody a rural Ethiopian community’s money practices in social (marriage and death) and religious contexts? Primary data on everyday practices of the community were collected. Analysis of our data reveals that new financial technology design should support lived experiences such as embedded social meaning, segregated and aggregate money control, restricted money use, identity extension and hiding, refusal and acceptance of donations, disclosed and secret money practices, and assigning aesthetics to money. The article concludes by discussing possible ways of mapping these concepts into financial system design, thus contributing toward the development of cashless transactions and a cashless society. © © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","Human computer interaction; User interfaces; Ethiopia; Financial system; Primary data; Rural community; Technology designs; Ubiquitous technology; Finance","","","","","","","Aaker, Jennifer Lynn, Why do people give?

Known as FinTech, these services influence competitive advantage for their ability to create innovation beyond the framework of conventional financial services. Acting as an enabler for creating innovation, Hitachi is taking a close look at AI, and working on its utilization in the financial sector. This article looks at phenomena such as FinTech and the IoT as precursors of changes in the financial industry. It discusses how AI is being used in the financial industry through activities designed to raise management KPIs by quantitatively evaluating organizational activity levels from action data acquired from wearable terminals. The article also describes the future outlook for AI use by examining concepts such as the development of business applications that use embedded AI.","","","","","","","","","Fintech Revolution, (2015); Transactions of the Institute of Electronics Information and Communication Engineers, (2013); Yano, Kazuo, Measuring happiness using wearable technology:Technology for boosting productivity in knowledge work and service businesses, Hitachi Review, 64, 8, pp. 517-524, (2015); Invisible Hand of Data the Rule for People Organizations and Society Uncovered by Wearable Sensors, (2014)","","","Hitachi Ltd.","","","","","","0018277X","","HITAA","","English","Hitachi Rev.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84978370420"

With a model of two-sided market with vertical restraints, we derive the following results. When only the entry of a vertically integrated (or end-to-end service) provider is allowed, either all merchants opt for multi-homing or no entry occurs, regardless of the regulatory requirement. On the other hand, if the entry of a downstream-only (or front-end service) provider is allowed, a partial multi-homing equilibrium could emerge under certain conditions, in which the entry of an end-to-end service provider does not occur. Without regulation, however, the vertically integrated incumbent does not voluntarily provide the back-end service to the entrant in general. This suggests the need for proper regulatory measures to reach a socially desirable outcome from the new entry in the retail payments market. © 2016 Korean Securities Association.","End-to-end; Entry; FinTech; Front-end; Retail payment","","","","","","","","Boom in Global Fintech Investment A New Growth Opportunity for London Technical Report, (2014); Anderson, Ross J., The economics of information security, Science, 314, 5799, pp. 610-613, (2006); Armstrong, Mark, Competition in two-sided markets, RAND Journal of Economics, 37, 3, pp. 668-691, (2006); Journal of Law and Economics, (1983); Managing Information Risk and the Economics of Security, (2009); Banks New Competitors Starbucks Google and Alibaba Harvard Business Review Online, (2014); World Payments Report 2013 Technical Report, (2013); World Payments Report 2015 Technical Report, (2015); Choi, Jay Pil, Tying in two-sided markets with multi-homing, Journal of Industrial Economics, 58, 3, pp. 607-626, (2010); Non Banks in Retail Payments, (2014)","E.

In addition, it analyzed the causal relationship between concern for information privacy and self-efficacy by adopting them as moderating variables. Results suggested that usefulness, ease of use and credibility had an effect on intention to use, and self-efficacy was found to have an moderating effect on independent and dependent variables. Further, concern for information privacy was found to be a factor obstructing the path to intention to use. The implications of this study are that in the promotion of payment-type Fintech services, convenience and usefulness are the most critical and influential variables in terms of usage, while government deregulation and stronger security are called for from an institutional aspect. © Research India Publications.","Elaboration likelihood model; Fintech; K pay; Mobile payment service","","","","","","","","Communication and Persuasion Central and Peripheral Routes to Attitude Change, (1986); Davis, Fred D., Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and user acceptance of information technology, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 13, 3, pp. 319-339, (1989); Financial Terminology Dictionary, (2015); Schierz, Paul Gerhardt, Understanding consumer acceptance of mobile payment services: An empirical analysis, Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 9, 3, pp. 209-216, (2010); Journal of Korean Association of Computer Education, (2015); Bhattacherjee, Anol, Influence processes for information technology acceptance: An elaboration likelihood model, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 30, 4, pp. 805-825, (2006); Korean Journal of Information Technology Services, (2015); Journal of Society for E Business Studies, (2011); Information Technology and Management, (2000); Information Systems Review, (2007)","","","Research India Publications subscription@ripublication.com","","","","","","09734562","","","","English","Int.

Author John Waupsh is the Chief Innovation Officer at Kasasa, where he helps spearhead financial product development and implementation across hundreds of institutions. In this guide, he draws on more than a decade in the industry to offer clear, practical advice for competing with the megabanks, direct banks, non-banks, and financial technology companies. The discussion separates futurist thinking from today's realities, and dispels common myths surrounding the U.S. community banking model in order to shed light on the real challenges facing community banking institutions. It follows with clear solutions, proven strategies, and insight from experts across banking and fintech. All arguments are backed by massive amounts of data, and the companion website provides presentation-ready visualizations to help you kickstart change within your team. In the U.S. and around the globe, fintech companies and non-banks alike are creating streams of banking services that are interesting, elegant, and refreshing—and they're winning the hearts and minds of early adopters. Not a one-size-fits-all approach, this book offers many different tactics for community banks and credit unions to compete and flourish in the new world. • Analyze fintech's threat to the community banking model • Learn where community banking must improve to compete • Disprove the myths to uncover the real challenges banks face • Adopt proven strategies to bring your organization into the future Community banks and credit unions were once the go-to institutions for local relationship banking, but their asset share has been on the decline for three decades as the big banks just got bigger. Now, fintech companies are exploiting inefficiencies in the traditional banking model to streamline service and draw even more market share, as community banking executives are left at a loss for fresh tactics and forward-looking strategy.

This paper explores the complexity of Fintech, and attempts a definition, drawn from a process of reviewing more than 200 scholarly articles referencing the term Fintech and covering a period of more than 40 years. The objective of this study is to offer a definition which is distinct as well as succinct in its communication, yet sufficiently broad in its range of application. As the origins of the term can neither be unequivocally placed in academia nor in practice, the definition concentrates on extracting out the quintessence of Fintech using both spheres. Applying semantic analysis and building on the commonalities of 13 peerreviewed definitions of the term, it is concluded that Fintech is a new financial industry that applies technology to improve financial activities. The implications as well as the shortcomings of this definition are discussed. © 2021 Journal of Innovation Management.

Therefore, this study will focus on reviewing the information security framework by adopting up-to-date standards as the way to counter financial information theft.","Cyberattack; Fintech; Hacker; Information Security System","Crime; Electronic commerce; Finance; Network security; Personal computing; Security of data; Cyber-attacks; Financial information; Financial institution; Fintech; Hacker; Remote location; Computer crime","","","","","","","Generic Tasks in Knowledge Based Reasoning High Level Building Blocks for Expert System Design IEEE Expert, (1986); Raychaudhuri, Dipankar, WirelessATM networks: Architecture, system design and prototyping, IEEE Personal Communications, 3, 4, pp. 42-49, (1996); North Carolina Banking Institute, (2016); Bitcoin A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System, (2008)","","Peng, L.","CEUR-WS","","16th International Conference on Electronic Business, ICEB 2016","2016-12-04 through 2016-12-08","Xiamen","128172","16830040","","","","English","Proc.

FIDO services are adapting a variety of service areas such as easy payment, money transfer, ATM withdrawal/savings, and single sign-on, etc. Because FIDO service uses standard public key cryptography techniques to provide stronger authentication and securely saves a user's bio-information in the smartphone. But when registered, FIDO only confirms the match between pre-enrolled fingerprints and the one on the registration process. In other words, FIDO is not able to verify the person's identity. The user has to register his/her biometric information in each sites. It is our purpose to solve these problems by implementing FIDO and PKI technologies adapted in current FIDO service and accredited certification system.

Yet this diversification has the banking landscape has not resolves credit allocation inefficiency. Indeed, whilst SME represent 80 % of the economic output of the country, it is only receiving 20 % of the credit originated by banks. This has spurred the development of shadow banking, an informal and unregulated network of lenders and borrowers. The emergence of Financial Technology has allowed for this activity digitized itself in the form of Peer-to-peer lending channel. The combination of and unregulated market and large credit gap has lead to the emergence of a sector that had only one platform in 2007 and over 2000 in 2015.

Financial technologies (FinTech) have become an integral part of banking, and nowadays banks have started to compete beyond financial services facing increasing competition from nonfinancial institutions providing, for example, payment services. Start-up service providers, search engines, and social networks have expanded their services ""interfering"" in the fields traditionally covered by banks. The rapid rise of FinTech has changed the business landscape in banking asking for more innovative solutions. These recent tendencies require the banks to increase investment in FinTech, rethink service distribution channels, especially the business-to-consumers models, increase further standardization of backoffice functions, etc. Some members of the financial services industry see the boom in FinTech as a threat to traditional banking industry. Others believe that FinTech has become a challenge that can be turned into an opportunity as it provides more flexibility, better functionality in some areas, and aggregation of services. The aim of the paper is to analyze the recent trends in banking, identifying opportunities and risks of FinTech for banks. A timely integration of FinTech into business allows banks to get an advantage in growing competition. This paper provides an extensive analysis of recent trends in FinTech and banking, examining experience of leading European and US banks, as well as surveys conducted among members of the financial services industry in different countries. The authors have studied the development of the financial innovation and technology market, assessed the existing practices applied in the field of FinTech, identified the main risks related to development of FinTech and financial innovations the banks are exposed to on the micro- and macrolevel. The paper provides recommendations for regulators and banks to ensure reduction of risks associated with development of FinTech. Analysis of FinTech market has shown growing competition, including from nonfinancial institutions. The paper provides practical recommendations to commercial banks for strengthening the position in financial innovations and controlling the risks associated with introduction of financial innovations. © © 2017 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited all Rights of Reproduction in Any form Reserved.","Banking innovations; FinTech; Risks","","","","","","","","undefined; undefined; Alt, Rainer, The rise of customer-oriented banking - Electronic markets are paving the way for change in the financial industry, Electronic Markets, 22, 4, pp. 203-215, (2012); Evolution of Fintech A New Post Crisis Paradigm, (2015); American Banker; Deutsche Bank Research, (2014); undefined; undefined, (2015); undefined; Kpmg","","","Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.

Crowdlending and Digital Advice offer additional opportunities for customers to manage their assets. In the banking market, “FinTechs” are the most notable example of what Schumpeter described as “creative destruction”. They could threaten the existence of established banks. Therefore the banks should use the FinTechs as a testing laboratory for customer behavior and testing ground for a more modern marketing policy. This environment gives rise to concerns that there may develop an unregulated area of shadow banks. But it should be considered that a level playing fi eld has to be ensured and that innovative processes and products are not stalled. A potential advantage of Digital Advice is that consumers can have the possibility to access the relevant information they need to make their fi nancial decisions. Consumers, in turn, are only able to benefi t from this advantage if competition between fi nancial service providers leads to a supply of clear and comprehensible information about fi nancial products and an appropriate degree of data security. The rise of Big Data analyses in retail banking allows a more precise estimation of creditworthiness risk as well as a consumer’s willingness-to-pay, propensity to switch and responsiveness to marketing offers. This not only impacts on competition, it represents major challenges for policymakers, authorities and consumers alike. © 2016 Springer Verlag.

In parallel with the regulatory changes, the banks are subject to pressure from accelerated technology development and social changes. These two factors influence the behavior of customers and induce changes in the customer relationship management (CRM). Taking the example of retail banking, the factors and their impacts are explained. Additionally, a view on the FinTech industry is presented, highlighting areas where traditional financial institutions are losing market share to technology-savvy and socially oriented new ventures with exceptional CRM capabilities. The conclusion contains proposed strategic actions that need to be undertaken in order to prepare the financial services industry for managing customer relationships in the increasingly technosocial environment. © 2016.

Author Paul Schulte, former economic analyst with the National Security Council, draws upon his own decade-spanning research to demonstrate how unethical banking practices provide the brute force that drives political and economic crises worldwide. By unbundling how credit markets work, this authoritative guide provides deep insight into crisis avoidance and detection, successful investment climates, and the groundwork that must be in place for policy makers to build a sound basis for economic growth. Clear, succinct case studies provide examples of policy and its effects on economic stability, giving you a stronger understanding of the network of forces that determine how loan/deposit ratios behave around the world. Countries that lend more than they save consistently get into trouble, with catastrophic consequences for the rich and middle class as well as the politicians. This book shows how credit excesses bring about price collapse in stocks, currencies, and real estate, and provides direction for change in the context of global economics. •Dive deep into the mechanisms underlying the credit markets •Learn how unregulated borrowing leads to socioeconomic crises •Examine real-world policy options through global case studies •Discover how credit rises are best detected and avoided An economic climate in which even the smallest hiccup can have long-lasting consequences should be the ideal impetus for a close scrutiny of global banking practices and economic policy. The Next Revolution in our Credit-Driven Economy takes you behind the scenes for a new perspective, and a more informed look at where the world needs to begin changing. The second half of the book will take a look at the revolution driving financial technology. Companies in Silicon Valley and giants like Alibaba are challenging the landscape for banking. This has profound implications for policy makers, banks and for a new class of entrepreneurs who are developing software which is taking away market share from bank and challenging decades-old financial empires. The book will explore the reasons why many global banks remain flat-footed. It will go into detail about the new companies and software that are moving in the Far East and with innovations in securities, bonds, foreign exchange, retail lending and SME lending. Lastly the book will look at the strategy behind Alibaba and how it will challenge many companies from a powerful base inside China. © 2015 by John Wiley & Sons Singapore Pte. Ltd.

This book focuses on the role of technology in global finance and reflects on the ethical and societal meaning and impact of financial information and communication technologies (ICTs). Exploring the history, metaphysics, and geography of money, algorithms, and electronic currencies, the author argues that financial ICTs contribute to impersonal, disengaged, placeless, and objectifying relations, and that in the context of globalization these ‘distancing’ effects render it increasingly difficult to exercise and ascribe responsibility. Caught in the currents of capital, it seems that both experts and lay people have lost control and lack sufficient knowledge of what they are doing. There is too much epistemic, social, and moral distance. At the same time, the book also shows that these electronically mediated developments do not render global finance merely ‘virtual’, for its technological practices remain material and place–bound, and the ethical and social vulnerabilities they create are no less real. Moreover, understood in terms of technological practices, global finance remains human through and through, and there is no technological determinism. Therefore, Money Machines also examines the ways in which contemporary techno-financial developments can be resisted or re–oriented in a morally and socially responsible direction – not without, but with technology. As such, it will appeal to philosophers and scholars across the humanities and the social sciences with interests in science and technology, finance, ethics and questions of responsibility. © Mark Coeckelbergh 2015.

In this enhancement program, the FSA recommended that regional financial institutions introduce new financial products such as collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) and collateralized bond obligations (CBOs). However, this was left up to each institution's discretion rather than being mandatory. This resulted in a large difference in the introduction of new products. Therefore, this article has analysed what kinds of credit associations favourably increased the use of new financial products. As a result, it has been confirmed that the larger their lending shares and management scale and the better their business conditions are, the more positively they work on the introduction of new products. Considering the fact that relationships between financial institutions and enterprises tend to be fixed in Japan, this means that medium and small enterprises will have restrictions on the financial products they can use depending on the situation of their main banks. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","","credit provision; financial services; institutional framework; lending behavior; small and medium-sized enterprise; Japan","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS","This research is financially supported by the Grant-in-Aid from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (Kakenhi).","Boot, Arnoud W.

The value of the asset lies in its transactional relations with other assets in the ecosystem or in other words being part of the architecture of related assets. It is argued that the deployment of financial trading software, as a product in brokerage houses in the emerging securities trading ecosystem in India by the software firm called Financial Technologies (FT), hastened institutionalization of new rules governing transactions embedded in the software design. As a result, FT implicitly collaborated with the regulator and other ecosystem participants who coordinated the innovation in design of the ecosystem. The software firm went on to expand the market for its own products (trading software) by incubating exchange ventures. This was achieved through a strategy of spawning of linked subsidiaries that led to both a growth of the trading ecosystem and further entrenchment of the innovated ecosystem. © 2010, IGI Global.","","","","","","","","","On Poetic Imagination and Reverie, (1971); Biomedical Innovation in India with A Comparison to China and Others, (2008); Nasdaq A History of the Market that Changed the World, (2002); Interim Report of the Janakiraman Committee to Probe into the Securities Scam, (1992); Report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee to Probe into the Securities Scam of 1992, (1992); Lucas, Henry C., The defensive use of IT in a newly vulnerable market: The New York Stock Exchange, 1980-2007, Journal of Strategic Information Systems, 18, 1, pp. 3-15, (2009); Institutions Institutional Change and Economic Performance, (1990); Epw, (2006); Approach Paper on Implementation of STP in Indian Markets, (2002); Revised Scheme for Implementing Straight Through Processing in India, (2004)","","","IGI Global","","","","","","","9781615206094","","","English","Cases on Technol.

The paper presents Technology Entrepreneurship in the curricula at a leading school of computer science and information systems, in which students are beginning to learn the theory and practice of skills needed to be business entrepreneurs or opportunists, and not mere scientists. The concentration in entrepreneurship is designed in the current model program in the disciplinary domain of the financial industry.
