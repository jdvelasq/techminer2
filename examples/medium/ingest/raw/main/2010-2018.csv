It is rarely mentioned in the media. Our research question is ‘Why does European microfinance suffer from a lack of visibility in the press?’ This study looked at news reports and press releases over a 18-month period (2016–2018) to check if European microfinance and its innovations were in the news. The study finds that, indeed, there are a lot of new innovations in finance. But, first, in Europe, the highly talked about fintech innovations are taking place outside of microfinance institutions (MFIs). Second, the innovations that are talked about in microfinance are taking place in developing countries out of Europe. The study followed this up by examining websites of some of the leading European fintech firms to see what they were doing that made them so visible. We share some best practices in the use of digital technologies by highly innovative fintech firms in areas that could be of use to MFIs in diverse sectors such as mobile payments, credit scoring, card readers, ATMs and management information systems. To become visible, European microfinance may need to demonstrate that it is doing new things and that it is using innovative technologies that helps it reduce costs, increase outreach and, thus, have an impact. Forii such as the European Microfinance Network and the European Microfinance Platform need to promote these innovations by offering appropriate awards. Finally, collaborating with training and educational institutes may help add to visibility. © 2018 Fortune Institute of International Business.","credit scoring; crowdfunding; digital; financial inclusion; Fintech; microfinance","","","","","","","","Abate, Gashaw Tadesse, Rural Finance and Agricultural Technology Adoption in Ethiopia: Does the Institutional Design of Lending Organizations Matter?, World Development, 84, pp. 235-253, (2016); Alam, GM Monirul, Influence of institutional access and social capital on adaptation decision: Empirical evidence from hazard-prone rural households in Bangladesh, Ecological Economics, 130, pp. 243-251, (2016); Ashta, Arvind, Evolution of Mobile Banking Regulations: A Case Study on Legislator's Behavior, Strategic Change, 26, 1, pp. 3-20, (2017); Advanced Technologies for Microfinance Solutions and Challenges, (2011); Management Information Systems for Microfinance Catalyzing Social Innovation for Competitive Advantage, (2015); Ashta, Arvind, FinTech evolution: Strategic value management issues in a fast changing industry, Strategic Change, 27, 4, pp. 301-311, (2018); Good Governance and Growth in Global Economy, (2017); Decision 03040941, (2007); Behl, Abhishek, Analysing the Barriers towards Sustainable Financial Inclusion using Mobile Banking in Rural India, Indian Journal of Science and Technology, 9, 15, (2016); Behl, Abhishek, Enablers and barriers of mobile banking opportunities in rural India: A strategic analysis, International Journal of Business Excellence, 10, 2, pp. 209-239, (2016)","A.

We focus on two types of ecosystem entities, namely, (1) firms that create, offer, and acquire FinTech services and (2) investors that fund and enable them. Our analyses reveal a highly skewed global footprint of FinTech activities, differential growth patterns across ecosystem segments, highly interdependent network structure, and a variegated nature of investments and acquisitions led by key incumbents and venture capital firms.

We study how two forces, regulatory differences and technological advantages, contributed to this growth. Difference in difference tests exploiting geographical heterogeneity induced by four specific increases in regulatory burden–capital requirements, mortgage servicing rights, mortgage-related lawsuits, and the movement of supervision to Office of Comptroller and Currency following closure of the Office of Thrift Supervision–all reveal that traditional banks contracted in markets where they faced more regulatory constraints; shadow banks partially filled these gaps. Relative to other shadow banks, fintech lenders serve more creditworthy borrowers and are more active in the refinancing market. Fintech lenders charge a premium of 14–16 basis points and appear to provide convenience rather than cost savings to borrowers. They seem to use different information to set interest rates relative to other lenders.

The paper describes features and characteristics of contemporary Russian fintech landscape and ecosystem. The examples of innovative financial services in Russia, including online banking and accounting, new payments and transfers services, platforms for crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending, blockchain initiatives, etc. are discussed. It is shown that fintech initiatives have not yet led to a radical transformation of the financial sector in Russia because participants of the fintech ecosystem have different points of view on fintech. Russian banks are now developing fintech initiatives within themselves, encouraging technology companies and fintech startups to focus their efforts on innovations that are aimed at improving processes, rather than opening new markets. The Government directs the main efforts to initiatives related to regulation of cryptocurrencies circulation and to introduction of blockchain in regtech and cybersecurity. Customers are interested in new and more convenient functionality in mobile applications, and they are waiting for new value propositions, including fast international money transfers, roboadvising, personal financial management, peer-to-peer lending. © 2018 IEEE.","digital banking; fintech; fintech business models; fintech infrastructure; fintech landscape","Blockchain; Ecosystems; Finance; Large scale systems; Business models; digital banking; fintech; fintech infrastructure; fintech landscape; Peer to peer networks","","","","","","","undefined; undefined; Financial Technology Startup Highlights Q1, (2018); Blockchain Technology Sector Overview Q1, (2018); Why do Banks Invest in Finteh but Avoid the Blocking Party, (2018); 2017 Fintech 100 Leading Global Fintech Innovators, (2020); Map of the Russian Fintech Market, (2018); Sathye, Milind, Adoption of Internet banking by Australian consumers: an empirical investigation, International Journal of Bank Marketing, 17, 7, pp. 324-334, (1999); International Journal of Service Banking, (2002); Developing A Fintech Ecosystem in the Gcc, (2015)","V.

We further aim to offer various perspectives in order to aid the understanding of the disruptive potential of FinTech, and its implications for the wider financial ecosystem. By drawing upon very recent and highly topical research on this area this study examines the implications for financial institutions, and regulation especially when technology poses a challenge to the global banking and regulatory system. It is driven by a wide-ranging overview of the development, the current state, and possible future of fintech. This paper attempts to connect practitioner-led and academic research. While it draws on academic research, the perspective it takes is also practice-oriented. It relies on the current academic literature as well as insights from industry sources, action research and other publicly available commentaries. It also draws on professional practitioners’ roundtable discussions, and think-tanks in which the author has been an active participant. We attempt to interpret banking, and regulatory issues from a behavioural perspective. The last crisis exposed significant failures in regulation and supervision. It has made the Financial Market Law and Compliance a key topic on the current agenda. Disruptive technological change also seems to be important in investigating regulatory compliance followed by change. We contribute to the current literature review on financial and digital innovation by new entrants where this has also practical implications. We also provide for an updated review of the current regulatory issues addressing the contextual root causes of disruption within the financial services domain. The aim here is to assist market participants to improve effectiveness and collaboration. The difficulties arising from extensive regulation may suggest a more liberal and principled approach to financial regulation. Disruptive innovation has the potential for welfare outcomes for consumers, regulatory, and supervisory gains as well as reputational gains for the financial services industry. It becomes even more important as the financial services industry evolves. For example, the preparedness of the regulators to instil culture change and harmonise technological advancements with regulation could likely achieve many desired outcomes. Such results range from achieving an orderly market growth, further aiding systemic stability and restoring trust and confidence in the financial system. Our action-led research results have implications for both research and practice. These should be of interest to regulatory standard setters, investors, international organisations and other academics who are researching regulatory and competition issues, and their manifestation within the financial and social contexts. As a perspective on a social construct, this study appeals to regulators and law makers, entrepreneurs, and investors who participate in technology applied within the innovative financial services domain. It is also of interest to bankers who might consider FinTech and strategic partnerships as a prospective, future strategic direction.1 © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Business models; Financial services; FinTech; Future research direction; RegTech; Regulation","","","","","","","Finally, only a few companies around the world are able to quickly export their fintech/regtech products and services to other countries. These are usually the ‘first movers’ and they are strongly financed by established financial markets and supported by advanced technology-platforms for scaling. For smaller markets, the small and medium-sized companies potentially face the future scaling and funding problem. Such companies may already be partially successful in their respective markets but further expansion financing for growth and internationalisation can come across the ‘bottleneck’ consequence. Much of the decline in the number of ‘smaller’ companies becoming listed is attributed to the very difficulty of being a small public company; this is reflected in the actions of venture capitalists, who once sought public listings when they wanted to exit their investments and now overwhelmingly choose private sales (Ritter, Economist, 2018 ). There is thus the real potential that firms are going to seek strategic alliances with incumbent financial institutions within the sector as their survival strategy. The risk for promising fintech/start-up companies is that there is also the potential to be constricted under the pressure of having to meet invariable demands in the services and products they offer. As such the issue becomes one of scale and capacity against larger firms, possibly the incumbents or indeed technology giants (i.e. Amazon, Apple etc.). This is important as at this stage. This is an industry with no ‘made’, crisis-resistant, proven businesses thus far. We do not know yet whether start-ups are mentally prepared for ‘exchanges’ in order to finance growth. In an industry under exponential development, pure cash exits do not exist as well for venture capital nor do acquisition evaluation models of a ‘made’ fintech business exist. Established institutions have the scale to absorb this which potentially gives rise to growth through a mergers and acquisitions wave. A pragmatic way for mergers to go through at this point is via exchanges of shares. The dangers in such a scenario are the ‘old-new firms’ where they ‘grow-and-consume’ entrants.","Global Fintech Investment Growth Continues in 2016 Driven by Europe and Asia, (2016); Agarwal, Sumit, Inconsistent regulators: Evidence from banking, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 129, 2, pp. 889-938, (2014); Complex Regulatory Landscape for Fintech an Uncertain Future for Small and Medium Sized Enterprise Lending, (2016); undefined, (2018); Allen, Franklin, Financial intermediaries and markets, Econometrica, 72, 4, pp. 1023-1061, (2004); Understanding Financial Crises, (2007); Allen, Franklin, Bubbles and crises, Economic Journal, 110, 460, pp. 236-255, (2000); Allen, Franklin, Financial contagion, Journal of Political Economy, 108, 1, pp. 1-33, (2000); Arner, Douglas W., FinTech, regTech, and the reconceptualization of financial regulation, Northwestern Journal of International Law and Business, 37, 3, pp. 373-415, (2017); Evolution of Fintech A New Post Crisis Paradigm, (2015)","","","Elsevier Inc.","","","","","","01486195","","JEBUD","","English","J.

In particular, we investigate the impact of FinTech on the Indonesian exchange rate (rupiah vis-a-vis the US dollar) and the inflation rate. Our results suggest that FinTech is able to reduce inflation and lead to a real appreciation of the rupiah against the US dollar, although its effect on the exchange rate is delayed. We explain our results and discuss future research directions. © 2018 Buletin Ekonomi Moneter dan Perbankan.

However, the current FinTech-industry still heavily depends on manual testing, which becomes the bottleneck of FinTech industry development. To automate the testing process, we propose an approach of black-box testing for a Fin- Tech system with effective tool support for both test generation and test oracles. For test generation, we first extract input categories from business-logic specifications, and then mutate real data collected from system logs with values randomly picked from each extracted input category. For test oracles, we propose a new technique of priority differential testing where we evaluate execution results of system-test inputs on the system's head (i.e., latest) version in the version repository (1) against the last legacy version in the version repository (only when the executed test inputs are on new, not-yet-deployed services) and (2) against both the currently-deployed version and the last legacy version (only when the test inputs are on existing, deployed services). When we rank the behavior-inconsistency results for developers to inspect, for the latter case, we give the currently-deployed version as a higherpriority source of behavior to check. We apply our approach to the CSTP subsystem, one of the largest data processing and forwarding modules of the China Foreign Exchange Trade System (CFETS) platform, whose annual total transaction volume reaches 150 trillion US dollars. Extensive experimental results show that our approach can substantially boost the branch coverage by approximately 40%, and is also efficient to identify common faults in the FinTech system. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Automated test generation; Black-box testing; FinTech","Automation; Data handling; Testing; Automated test generations; Deployed services; Differential testing; FinTech; Foreign exchange; Industry development; Software platforms; Test generations; Black-box testing","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1513939, 1564274, 1816615); National Science Foundation, NSF","","Global Fintech Investment Growth Continues in 2016, (2017); Jacoco Java Code Coverage Library, (2018); Cadar, Cristian, Klee: Unassisted and automatic generation of high-coverage tests for complex systems programs, pp. 209-224, (2019); Cadar, Cristian, EXE: Automatically generating inputs of death, Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 322-335, (2006); Fraser, Gordon, EvoSuite: Automatic test suite generation for object-oriented software, pp. 416-419, (2011); Hutchison, Casidhe, Robustness testing of autonomy software, Proceedings - International Conference on Software Engineering, pp. 276-285, (2018); Koopman, Philip J., Toward a scalable method for quantifying aspects of fault tolerance, software assurance, and computer security, 1998-November, pp. 103-131, (1998); Koopman, Philip J., Comparing operating systems using robustness benchmarks, Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems, pp. 72-79, (1997); Pacheco, Carlos, Randoop: Feedback-directed random testing for Java, Proceedings of the Conference on Object-Oriented Programming Systems, Languages, and Applications, OOPSLA, pp. 815-816, (2007); Taipale, Ossi, Trade-off between automated and manual software testing, International Journal of System Assurance Engineering and Management, 2, 2, pp. 114-125, (2011)","L.

With the increasing importance of bitcoin, many related topics require further clarification. Because bitcoin is a popular financial asset, determining whether the price information is fully circulated among trading platforms has been the focus of many studies in recent years. The method for verifying the efficient market hypothesis relates to whether the price series is a random walk; that is, whether a unit root exists. According to the literature, whether the price of bitcoin satisfies the efficient market hypothesis remains controversial; however, these studies have not considered nonlinear data structures. To deal with the structural change of data, this study employed different unit root tests, namely the Zivot-Andrews unit root test and Kapetanios-Shin unit root test, to investigate bitcoins' relationship to the efficient market hypothesis. If the efficient market hypothesis is validated, the price formed by the bitcoin trading platform is close to a perfectly competitive mechanism, and the information can be quickly and completely reflected in the price, with information of different trading platforms having mutual influence. Therefore, this study applied the threshold vector autoregressive model to explore price information transmission between various trading platforms. The contribution of this research is its exploration of the financial tools derived from the highly developed fields of financial science and technology. This is helpful for providing new methods for completing financial transactions or a platform for speculators to engage in arbitrage. © 2018 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology, Inc.

This paper clarified that FinTech modularizes financial technology. For that purpose, we analyzed the function and structure of FinTech. Also, although it is possible that FinTech could change the existing financial industry structure in Japan, the objective was to propose from the case consideration that the management strategy in that environment is Keystone Strategy. As a conclusion, FinTech was found to be modularized because it has increased its added value after fragmenting financial services technology and breaking it apart. In addition, even if it continues to stay in the integral part, its comprehensive financial services part is inferior to FinTech, so it was expected that it cannot stay in the integral. © 2018 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology, Inc.

In this paper, we examine the determinants of the use of FinTech finance by businesses, with a particular focus on the ownership, governance, and business practices that may modify the relationships with conventional motivations for external finance. Using a comprehensive sample of Chinese hi-tech small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), we find that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and family firms and financially constrained firms are respectively much less and much more likely to seek FinTech finance. In the Chinese context, we argue that part of this may be because of the relative ease with which SOE SMEs can access cheaper conventional finance through SOE banks. The quality of traditional relationship banking also affects the relative desirability of FinTech financing. As for family firms, we find that innovation, as exemplified by RD activity, effectively overrides any conventional reluctance to access external finance, suggesting the relative benefits of FinTech finance for innovative high-growth firms. © 2018 IEEE.","China; family firms; fintech; Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); state-owned enterprises (SOEs)","Engineering; Industrial engineering; China; Family firms; fintech; Small and medium-sized enterprise; State owned enterprise; Finance","","","","","","","Dorfleitner, Gregor, FinTech in Germany, pp. 1-121, (2017); Zhu, Xiaodong, Understanding China's growth: Past, present, and future, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 26, 4, pp. 103-124, (2012); Boycko, Maxim, A theory of privatisation, Economic Journal, 106, 435, pp. 309-319, (1996); Megginson, William Leon Bill, From state to market: A survey of empirical studies on privatization, Journal of Economic Literature, 39, 2, pp. 321-389, (2001); Econometrica, (1979); Economics of Shortage, (1980); Allen, Franklin, Law, finance, and economic growth in China, Journal of Financial Economics, 77, 1, pp. 57-116, (2005); Jensen, Michael C., Theory of the firm: Managerial behavior, agency costs and ownership structure, Journal of Financial Economics, 3, 4, pp. 305-360, (1976); Megginson, William Leon Bill, State ownership, soft-budget constraints, and cash holdings: Evidence from China's privatized firms, Journal of Banking and Finance, 48, pp. 276-291, (2014); Beck, Thorsten, Financing patterns around the world: Are small firms different?, Journal of Financial Economics, 89, 3, pp. 467-487, (2008)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","1st Annual International Symposium on Innovation and Entrepreneurship of the IEEE Technology and Engineering Management Society, TEMS-ISIE 2018","2018-03-30 through 2018-04-01","Beijing","140367","","9781538644751","","","English","TEMS-ISIE - Annu.

The rapid changes in technology due to the innovation has brought an impacts in changes on human lifestyle. Technology simplifies and accelerates human being in doing its activity. The development of digital technology (disruptive technology) has an impact on all aspects of human life. The purpose of this research is to see the phenomenon of the conventional banking in Indonesia to make changes in its business processes in order to compete with Fintechs Company that is growing rapidly. This research method looks at the phenomenon on conventional banking in Indonesia by looking at the impact of technology and digital. The first phenomenon is the rapid development in the world currently occur in the digital economy, one of which is a digital-based financial service known as financial technology (FinTech). The second phenomenon is digital technology has been able to change the behavior of Indonesian people in all aspects of life, such as electronic books, electronic newspapers, online sales and public transportation (taxis and motorcycles). The third phenomenon is FinTechs services in Indonesia include Payment channel system, Digital Banking, Online/Digital Insurance, Peer-to-peer (P2P) Lending and Crow funding. Banks should be able to balance the development of this digital technology by providing new products that are close to customer's wishes. There is a gap that has not been served by banks in Indonesia that resulted in the emergence of potential benefits that can be taken by Start-up Company (pioneer) FinTech in providing services and banking products. Banking in Indonesia can synergize with start-up companies (pioneer) FinTech by changing its business process by doing Business Process Reengineering (BPR). © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Finance; Peer to peer networks; Reengineering; Business process re-engineering; Digital technologies; Disruptive technology; Financial service; Potential benefits; Public transportation; research methods; Start-up companies; Electronic publishing","","","","","","","Financial Technology Trend Bisnis Keuangan Ke Depan, (2016); Financial Technology Fintech Di Indonesia Kuliah Umum Tentang Fintech Ibs, (2017); International Journal of Management Research and Review, (2011); Ringim, Kabiru Jinjiri, Exploring the implementation of business process reengineering in banks, Asian Social Science, 9, 11, pp. 243-253, (2013); Journal of US China Public Administration, (2015); Datamation, (1993); Barrett, John L., Process visualization getting the vision right is key, Information Systems Management, 11, 2, pp. 14-23, (1994); Information Systems Management Summer, (1993); Management Services, (1997); Al-Mashari, Majed A., BPR implementation process: An analysis of key success and failure factors, Business Process Management Journal, 5, 1, pp. 87-112, (1999)","","Abdullah, A.G.; Nandiyanto, A.B.D.; Warlina, L.; Kurniati, P.S.","Institute of Physics Publishing helen.craven@iop.org","","International Conference on Informatics, Engineering, Science and Technology, INCITEST 2018","2018-05-09 through 2018-05-10","Bandung","140092","17578981","","","","English","IOP Conf.

This growth indicates that people behaviour change in many aspects of life including in economy. One example is (Fintech P2P Lending). P2P lending is a service that offers online borrowing, lenders can loan to small business or individuals. This is in line with the Indonesia Financial Services Sector Master Plan 2015-2019. Indonesia support the rapid growth of the financial technology ecosystem, but there is need good understanding between related parties such as P2P Lending companies, lenders and borrowers. A system dynamics act as calculators to takes value to fill payoff table in game theory. Integration of system dynamics and game theory can produce the best strategy for Fintech P2P Lending in running its business while considering profit for lenders and borrowers. The best strategy is known by use non-cooperative and cooperative game theory. The result shown the best strategy for each player with non-cooperative game is when the company chooses a high level of profit margin, borrower chooses low level of debt time, and lender chooses high level of ROI. In cooperative game, the best strategy is when the company chooses a high level of profit margin, borrower chooses low level of debt time, and lender chooses low level of ROI. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.","","","","","","","","","Jakarta, (2017); Data Society Research Institute, (2015); G20 High Level Principles for Digital Financial Inclusion; Centria University of Applied Science, (2016); Issn Tangerang, (2017); Erman Researchgate, (2017); undefined, (2016); Springer, (2014); Safety Science, (2015); undefined","D.S.

Fintech has the potential to change financial intermediation structures substantially. It could disrupt existing intermediation with new business models empowered by intelligent algorithms, big data, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. Lower costs and potentially better consumer experiences could be the driving forces. Yet, empirically, fintech remains very small, especially in the European Union (EU). Even the largest fintech market, in China, is of marginal size compared to overall financial intermediation. In the EU, much of fintech is concentrated in the UK. We argue that policymakers need to consider four questions urgently. (i) Develop a European or national fintech market? (ii) What regulatory framework to pursue? (iii) Should supervision of fintech be exercised at the European level? (iv) What is the overall vision for the EU's financial system? Getting the answers to these questions right at an early stage of market development constitutes an opportunity to shape a stable and cost-efficient financial system. In contrast, late action could mean that Europe loses out to foreign competitors and misses an opportunity to improve financial intermediation in Europe. © The Author(s) 2018.

The states have historically overseen and regulated nonbank companies, including nonbank financial services providers like money transmitters, mortgage lenders, consumer lenders, and debt collectors. Applicable regulations include state safety and soundness requirements and both state and federal consumer protection and anti-money laundering laws. In 2016, the OCC announced its intention to create a new national bank charter for nonbank companies, thus pulling chartered nonbank fintech companies into the national bank regulatory system. This will potentially preempt and replace the licensing, regulation, and supervision responsibilities of state authorities while allowing circumvention of other regulatory safeguards. Moreover, this power grab by the OCC is beyond its authority as delegated by Congress. In addition to questions of the legality of the charters and whether state or federal regulators are better situated to regulate such institutions, the proposed charters raise significant concerns regarding the separation of commerce and banking that has been a hallmark of the U.S. financial regulatory system since the founding of the country. © 2018 George Washington University.

What is the role of institutional factors on the international allocation of fintech venture capital? Research Findings/Insights: We document a notable change in the pattern of fintech venture capital (VC) investments around the world relative to other types of investments after the global financial crisis. We show that fintech venture capital investments are relatively more common in countries with weaker regulatory enforcement and without a major financial center after the financial crisis. Also, we show the fintech boom is more pronounced for smaller private limited partnership venture capitalists that likely have less experience with prior venture capital booms and busts. These fintech VC deals are substantially more likely to be liquidated, especially when located in countries without a major financial center. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We build on the institutions and corporate governance literatures by showing the importance of enforcement in driving relative differences in investment patterns and investor participation. For entrepreneurial startups, regulatory arbitrage drives investment into countries with a dearth of enforcement and regulatory costs. We argue that the spike in fintech venture capital in certain countries is attributable to differential enforcement of financial institution rules amongst startups versus large established financial institutions after the financial crisis. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Regulatory arbitrage in the context of fintech venture capital can spur booms and busts. Less experienced venture capitalists seem more prone to undertake investments that exacerbate boom and bust cycles. National governance is strengthened by the enforcement of regulatory standards, and corporate governance through investor experience and oversight can mitigate these swings, and facilitate better investment outcomes. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Corporate Governance; Financial Regulation; Fintech; International Venture Capital; Regulatory Arbitrage","","","","","","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC","Funding text 1: The authors owe thanks to Lars Hornuf, Joseph McCahery, Elisa Ughetto, Silvio Vismara, and to the conference participants at McCarthy Tétrault, Toronto, March 2016, the 4th Crowdinvesting Symposium on “Financial Decision Making and the Internet” at the Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition, Munich, November 2016, and the CGIR Workshop on “Corporate Governance Implications of New Methods of Entrepreneurial Firm Formation”, University of Bergamo, June 2017, and the 5th Crowdinvesting Symposium on “The Regulation of FinTechs” at the Humboldt University of Berlin, October 2017.

The emergence of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) has changed the way humans interact with the surrounding world. In this paper, we present a proactive FinTech model that uses the IoT intelligence to deliver positive InsurTech feedback. We propose an InsurTech system with three main components: the monitoring and feedback device, the fog analytics engine, and the cloud server. The driving analytics use sensor-recorded data to calculate in real time the driving scores based on current driving patterns and road conditions. The feedback device then communicates with drivers providing helpful feedbacks and potential rewards. Given assertive recommendations offered by a system, the rational-economic model suggests that humans usually respond positively to cost minimizations and rewards maximizations. We have used real user data collected by the MapBar Auto Guard devices deployed in China to show an example of how IoT supports the implementation of the positive feedback paradigm. We believe our proactive FinTech model that speaks of actual costs and potential benefits in real time will offer an attractive service value and customer satisfaction. © 2018 IEEE.","Feedback; Fintech; InsurTech; UBI","Customer satisfaction; Internet of things; Cost minimization; Economic modeling; Fintech; InsurTech; Internet of thing (IOT); Potential benefits; Potential rewards; Technological advancement; Feedback","","","","","","","Lee, In, Fintech: Ecosystem, business models, investment decisions, and challenges, Business Horizons, 61, 1, pp. 35-46, (2018); Proceedings in International Conference on Information Systems Held at Dublin, (2016); Dhar, Vasant, Economic and business dimensions: FinTech platforms and strategy, Communications of the ACM, 60, 10, pp. 32-35, (2017); Zavolokina, Liudmila, The FinTech phenomenon: antecedents of financial innovation perceived by the popular press, Financial Innovation, 2, 1, (2016); Fin Ternet of Things how Iot Affects Financial Services, (2018); Al-Fuqaha, Ala Isam, Internet of Things: A Survey on Enabling Technologies, Protocols, and Applications, IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials, 17, 4, pp. 2347-2376, (2015); Gartner Research, (2017); Next Industrial Revolution, (2017); European Insurance, (2016); Global Fintech Survey, (2016)","","Brichni, M.; Huemer, C.; Proper, H.A.; Rozier, D.; Guerreiro, S.; Guedria, W.; Razo-Zapata, I.; Komarov, M.M.; Strecker, S.; Feltus, C.; Maltseva, S.V.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","20th IEEE International Conference on Business Informatics, CBI 2018","2018-07-11 through 2018-07-13","Vienna","139250","","9781538670163","","","English","Proceeding - IEEE Int.

Fin-tech itself can be described as an industry composed of companies that use new technology and innovation with available resources in order to compete in the marketplace of traditional financial institutions and intermediaries in the delivery of financial services. In Indonesia, Fin-tech has been widely developed in the past 3 years. Fin-tech is facing a new challenge as a new service for financial consumer which adapts new way of living in modern digital technology era. Basically, Fin-tech is offering three main categories such as payment, personal finance and financing. In financing application there are peer to peer financing, social crowd funding and also loan marketplace. All of this kind application has some issues in legal framework and data protection due to the using of communication technologies such as internet, social networks, Smartphone, massive use of data with the Big Data, connected objects etc. The using of big data and those new technologies have created new opportunities for these sectors, these developments also raise significant data protection concerns. This paper will discuss two legal issues of Fin-tech, the legal aspect and the data protection. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Consumer; Data Protection; Financial Technology","Big data; Commerce; Data privacy; Economic and social effects; Environmental protection; Facings; Finance; Fins (heat exchange); Peer to peer networks; Planning; Social sciences computing; Sustainable development; Communication technologies; Connected objects; Consumer; Digital technologies; Financial institution; Financial service; New technologies; Technology service; Consumer protection","","","","","Foundation for Contemporary Arts","Up to July 2017, a total of 180 startup fin-tech has been operating in Indonesia. Looking this situation, the Indonesian government responds quickly this phenomenon. Indonesia Financial Service Authority (OJK) and Indonesian Central Bank (BI) release new regulations regarding fin-tech service. Although not directly address fin-tech in specific; however, this regulations at least provides an opportunity for fin-tech to flourish. This means that the government responds to this situation well. OJK released regulation POJK No.77/POJK.01/2016 regarding Money Lending Services Based on Information Technology. Meanwhile, BI released PBI No. 18/40/PBI/2016 on Management Processing of Payment Transactions. The two regulations regulate the two most important things in the fin-tech service: peer to peer lending system and payment gateway system. Regulations issued by OJK and BI adopting the Regulatory Sandbox. What does it mean with Regulatory Sandbox? Regulatory Sandbox introduced by The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the financial body in United Kingdom in April 2016. Basically Regulatory Sandbox is a set of regulation which allows both fin-tech startups and established company to test their innovative product in the area of Fin-Tech. It is yet the best approach when dealing with the new technology. Regulators promote the innovation to grow faster and bigger by lowering barriers but still protect the consumers from the harmful effect of new product.","Schueffel, Patrick, Taming the beast: A scientific definition of fintech, Journal of Innovation Management, 4, 4, pp. 32-54, (2016); Evolution of Fintech, (2015); Evolution of Fintech A New Post Crisis Paradigm, (2015); Penetrasi Dan Perilaku Pengguna Internet Indonesia, (2016); Indonesian Fintech Report, (2016); Regulation Tomorrow What Happens When Technology is Faster than the Law, (2016); Marketeers, (2017); Business Models and Economics of Peer to Peer Lending, (2016); Fintech World and New Styles in Payment, (2016); Applications of Blockchain Technology in Fintech, (2017)","","","Institute of Physics Publishing helen.craven@iop.org","","International Conference on Industrial Technology for Sustainable Development 2017, ICon-ITSD 2017","2017-10-25 through 2017-10-26","Makassar","138331","17551307","","","","English","IOP Conf.

Various types of technology based innovative financial business models or financial technology (fin-tech) are growing rapidly around the world, including Indonesia. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) incorporates the fin-tech progress in its work plan in 2017 in the perspective of financial stability. In Indonesia, the Financial Services Authority has issued the Financial Services Authority Regulation No: 77/FSAR.01/2016 on Technology-Based Lending and Borrowing Services to provide a legal basis for fin-tech activities, in particular services with peer to peer lending models. In practice, fin-tech in Indonesia is not only used to facilitate lending and borrowing, but also used for other business models, especially start-up business, investment and social activities, which are not included in the scope of lending and borrowing. On the other hand, fin-tech development in Indonesia is expected to contribute to economic development, particularly in facilitating micro, small and medium enterprises to gain access to finance. The advantages of fin-tech include cost efficiency and ease of access to finance, but on the other hand there are some obstacles and risks that potentially arise, such as credit risk, insufficient technology, misuse of funds and user/consumer data and protection of national interests such as money laundering as well as disruption to monetary stability. Therefore, in addition to the need for comprehensive regulation, supervisory aspects by the financial services authorities are urgently needed to make fin-tech a part of the financial services sector. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Fin-tech- legal challenges- financial industry","Economics; Fins (heat exchange); Investments; Planning; Risk assessment; Sustainable development; Authority regulations; Economic development; Financial industry; Financial services sector; Financial stability; Peer-to-peer lending; Small and medium enterprise; Technology advances; Economic and social effects","","","","","","","Journal of Financial Transformation, (2016); Journal of Financial Perspectives, (2015); Director of Supervision and Fin Tech Licensing Only 7 Fintech Companies Listed in Fsa; There are 600 Fintech in Indonesia Only 157 are Reported to Fsa, (2017); Fintech Innovation an Overview, (2016); Message from Bank Indonesia Governor Launching Bank Indonesia Fintech Office, (2016)","","","Institute of Physics Publishing helen.craven@iop.org","","International Conference on Industrial Technology for Sustainable Development 2017, ICon-ITSD 2017","2017-10-25 through 2017-10-26","Makassar","138331","17551307","","","","English","IOP Conf.

The task of integrating such system is quite complicated, especially the integration of the financial technology system. In addition to being integrated, the flow of data and business processes must effectively reach every part which has interests in the process and the data. Business productivity can be achieved if the required data flows smoothly and is accessible as efficient as possible. Similarly, a bank which usually uses more than one information systems, when it need to combine financial statements from different bank systems must go through a data transformation mechanism to be accessible. Especially if the users of some bank accounts must access all their banking accounts at one time, of course, this would not be easy. As a response to those situations, in this research we proposed a financial technology application integration based on SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) which could be used to combine financials statements of all integrated banks every month. The data required to create a composite report will be directly taken from the system of any bank by utilizing web services. It is expected that the results from this study could help the parties interested in SOA-based Fin Tech with the understanding and description of SOA, such as: how it works, its benefits, and the role of SOA layers implemented in Fin Tech applications. © 2018 IEEE.","Architecture; Fin Tech; SOA; System","Architecture; Citrus fruits; Finance; Fins (heat exchange); Information services; Integration; Metadata; Web services; Business productivity; Customer expectation; Fin Tech; Financial transactions; Soa (serviceoriented architecture); System; Technology application; Technology Integration; Service oriented architecture (SOA)","","","","","","","Communications of the ACM, (2003); Meredith, L.

The blockchain technology threatens to be even more disruptive as it may pull the carpet from under the monetary system as well as the property rights as we know them today.

Recent years have seen a remarkable trend for companies in all business sectors and industries to try to improve and extend the lifetime of their existing businesses and services by introducing the newest technologies. There is a requirement for FinTech or IoT to be integrated into the society in order to move beyond this goal, and to create new business models or services that are not descended from their existing business fields or services itself. While some simply maintain existing business areas that lack potential for company development, several companies find it difficult to develop business through advanced concepts, because they are bound by their existing capabilities. Thus, there is a need to find ways to create the business models and services that surpass vested interests, are sustainable, and which fulfil the demands of the society. Products and services using technology have been in demand through the years, and occasionally, they can actually threaten the survival of existing businesses; this clearly demonstrates that such products and services are truly indispensable for social creation. This paper aims to discuss the conceptualization of approaches necessary to create such products and services, and to provide ideas for new services by introducing examples. © 2018","Business model; FinTech; Innovation; IoT; Mobility","Carrier mobility; Business modeling; Business models; Business sector; Company development; FinTech; New business models; New services; Products and services; Internet of things","","","","","","","undefined, (2010); undefined, (2010)","T.

Hundreds of mobile payment services have been introduced across the globe. Strikingly, many of these efforts have failed. This study analyzes whether mobile payment is still relevant in the fintech era. I compare three mobile payment projects – Oi Paggo in Brazil, TCASH in Indonesia, and M-PESA in Kenya – as case studies. I argue that mobile payment systems currently operate in such complex and multidimensional networks with shared common infrastructures and compete for producing and providing value to the customers on the basis of these infrastructures. Three attributes of industry and network structure are immediately of interest: (1) cutting the vertical supply chain more finely may encourage large players to extend their domination, (2) the basic platform continues to be governed by multinational operators (MNOs) – telecom firms, and (3) openness may be decreasing or increasing even as the number of independent parties in the supply chain drops. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Case study methods; Developing countries; Financial services; Financial transactions; Fintech; Innovation; Mobile payment; Modularity; Networks; Payment networks; Platforms; Technology ecosystems","Developing countries; Finance; Global system for mobile communications; Networks (circuits); Supply chains; Case study methods; Financial service; Financial transactions; Fintech; Mobile payment; Modularity; Platforms; Technology ecosystem; Electronic money","","","","","","","Adomavicius, Gediminas, Making sense of technology trends in the information technology landscape: A design science approach, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 32, 4, pp. 779-809, (2008); Adomavicius, Gediminas, Understanding evolution in technology ecosystems, Communications of the ACM, 51, 10, pp. 117-122, (2008); Au, Yoris A., The economics of mobile payments: Understanding stakeholder issues for an emerging financial technology application, Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 7, 2, pp. 141-164, (2008); Baldwin, Carliss Y., Where do transactions come from?

Financial services companies are trying to become more customer focused, but struggling to help huge customer segments, particularly in developing economies. Alternative financial models and tools are emerging, which are being embraced by consumers and incumbents. In large parts of the developing world, alternative services are leapfrogging traditional finance, meaning more and more people have access to finance without ever needing a bank. Meanwhile, the barriers around financial services companies are crumbling, as they become more reliant on integration with new providers and alternative types of service. Financial products can no longer be viewed in isolation, but as part of a service landscape that supports how people do life. This means rethinking how our businesses are designed, motivated and organised, and letting go of the old ways of thinking about supply and demand. With practical steps businesses and, in particular, financial services organisations need to take to participate in a global service ecosystem, this book will be of interest to financial professionals who work in banking, financial technology, and development finance. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2018.

Users’ perceived ease of use is the strongest influenced by mobile payment knowledge, whereas personal innovativeness is the most influential factor to the usefulness of mobile payment.

But the financial regulatory reforms enacted since the crisis have been premised on an outdated idea of what financial services look like and how they are provided. Regulation has failed to take into account the rise of financial technology (or ""fintech"") firms and the fundamental changes they have ushered in on a variety of fronts, from the way that banking works, to the way that capital is raised, even to the very form of money itself. These changes call for a wide-ranging reconceptualization of financial regulation in an era of technology-enabled finance. In particular, this Article argues that regulators' focus on preventing the risks associated with ""too big to fail"" institutions overlooks the conceptually distinct risks associated with small, decentralized financial markets. In many ways, these risks can be greater than those presented by large institutions because decentralized fintech markets are more vulnerable to adverse economic shocks, less transparent to regulators, and more likely to encourage excessively risky behavior by market participants. The Article concludes by sketching out a variety of regulatory responses that better correspond to fintech's particular risks and rewards. © 2017 Vanderbilt Law Review.

These efforts have given rise to numerous approaches, including, most notably, fintech-bank partnerships structured to avoid state licensing regimes. While another obvious option is a bank charter, few fintech firms have seriously considered bank charters due to a number of cost, compliance and other factors that make becoming a bank too burdensome. Recent developments, however, suggest that the bank charter option may be worthy of reconsideration. This article explores the opportunities, costs, risks and other factors that fintech firms should weigh in considering a bank charter and various charter options currently available or in development in the United States. Notably, the scope of this article does not include non-U.S. charter and similar options, of which there are a number of alternatives, including in the UK, Singapore and other jurisdictions. © 2018 Banking Law Journal.

Despite access to fast-paced technology known as FinTech, an antiquated business model and internal organizational paralysis do not allow for the creation of a truly beloved brand and are stifling change. To survive and thrive when their competition is catching up, banks must understand the principles behind Emotional Banking-a cultural change concept that brings the consumer to the center of rethinking banking products and delivery. This book starts with a history of the space then moves into an overview of what FinTech is. After discussing the state of banking today including stories from the biggest names in the industry, the concept of Emotional Banking and Brand are introduced as an answer to the problems outlined above. It concludes with examples of best practices and a hands-on approach on how to change the inertia, become a brand and make customers fall in love with their bank. Some of the questions this book tackles include: · Why don't banks ""care""? · How many banks will survive? · What is FinTech and why does it matter? · Can Banks become beloved brands and find their way to the consumer's heart? · Why is there a disconnect between what we say and what we do in the industry? · Is inertia in banking a result of broken internal culture? · Which big brand or challenger will be at the top in 5 years? © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2018.

Re-visiting past and present discourses can be illuminating in at least three ways: it can reveal the broader picture of the present financialized and technologized world and the rise of financial technologies; it can provide scholars with new vocabularies, concepts, and metaphors to comprehend present-day phenomena and developments; and it can reveal the variety of commitments that are possible, today, too. This article starts with a discussion of the original ‘crisis of modernity’ discourses (avant la lettre), in which the clashing arguments of Comte and Tocqueville are featured, and a discussion of a second ‘crisis of modernity’ that developed in the context of the ‘Great Depression.’ A third ‘crisis of modernity’ discourse emerged in the wake of the financial crises of the 1970s. Such crises are still ongoing and discussed within the boundaries of the third ‘crisis of modernity’ discourse. How financial technologies do and do not fit within this third discourse is discussed in the remainder of this article. © 2017, The Author(s).","Crisis; Democracy; Financial technologies; Financialization; Ideology; Mechanization modernity discourses","","","","","","University of Twente","","Abolafia, Mitchel Y., Can speculative bubbles be managed?

This means that Fintech companies, who could so far often rely on a comparatively lenient regulatory regime, will now have to give serious thoughts on compliance with applicable regulatory rules. Operating in a highly regulated environment is tedious, but not all bad-companies that can play the regulatory game well have a strategic advantage, especially with regard to time-to-market and scaling. Nothing spells missed opportunity like a competitor building market share with a copycat product whilst you are still waiting for your license! Written for professionals, this book helps anyone whose job has to do with formulating or executing a Fintech startup strategy or whose job touches financial services regulation, or anyone who simply wants an easy- to-read introduction to financial services and their regulation. • Describes the purpose of and principle behind modern financial services regulation • Explains how to include regulation into a startup's strategic planning to optimize time-to-market and scaling • Gives an overview of the entire financial services space, and which regulations apply where • Gives detailed references to 20 key regulations in the EU regulatory system, including PSD, GDPR, CRD, AMLD, MiFID, UCITSD, AIFMD The first part introduces financial services regulation, its purpose, how it is created (especially in the EU and in the US), and it develops a framework for including regulations into the strategic planning of a company. It also gives a rundown of the current financial services space-players and products-and its key regulations. The second part describes a regulatory system in more detail. The system chosen is the EU because it is more consistent and unified than the US system where a lot of the regulation still is created at the state-level. However, as most financial regulation nowadays is determined at the global level, the principles found in EU regulation will be by and large also be found the US and other systems. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Nonetheless, in recent years, FinTechs - un-regulated start-ups applying technology to finance - have exponentially accelerated such race, making innovative regulatory approaches and new perspectives necessary. The present paper discusses relevant issues pertaining to the regulation of FinTech, using financial-return crowdfunding (FR-crowdfunding) as case study and model, deriving from its FinTech, shadow banking and collaborative economy natures, important indications for regulators. Current trends in regulating FR-crowdfunding in Member States are also analysed, together with related shortcomings and benefits, with the view to proposing a more harmonised regime for the sector, tailored to its risks and features and advancing Capital Markets Union objectives. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","","","","","","","","","Journal of Finance, (1981); American Economic Review, (1988); Financial Innovation, (1992); Oxford Handbook of Banking, (2014); Consequences of Financial Innovation A Counterfactual Research Agenda, (2011); Financial Innovation Too Much or Too Little, (2013); SMU L Rev, (1998); Miller, Merton H., Financial Innovation: The Last Twenty Years and the Next, Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 21, 4, pp. 459-471, (1986); Financial Innovation, (1999); Financial Innovation","","","Walter de Gruyter GmbH","","","","","","16132548","","","","English","Eur.

Indeed, the propensity toward complexity is considerable, bridging a range of financial services, markets, innovations, industry participants, infrastructures, and technologies. This study aims to improve comprehension of the global fintech landscape. It is based on the analysis of start-ups that participated in SWIFT's Innotribe competition. We used cluster analysis to group 402 fintech start-up firms, and then selected representative cases to create a foundational understanding of the structure of the fintech landscape. The main findings of this work are: (1) the development of fintech clusters to classify core services, business infrastructures, and underlying component technologies, which characterize fintech; (2) an analysis of how fintechs synthesize different technologies to restructure flows of financial information through competitive and cooperative mechanisms of disinter-mediation, extension of access, financialization, hybridization, and personalization; (3) an analysis of related strategies for value creation connected with the competitive and cooperative mechanisms that were identified.

In the past decade, these digital applications have profoundly restructured economic development and power relations in Chinese society. This article examines how the promotions of fintech media and communication technologies for transactions, loans, investments and many other financial practices–engender and enlarge Alibaba’s digital financial platform, Ant Financial, the largest digital financial company in China. From a political economy of communication perspective, we consider Ant Financial as a product of data-centric corporate convergence in which fintech media have extracted user data from Alibaba’s e-commerce and digital payment platforms and utilized this data to drive Alibaba’s growth in financial businesses. The consolidation of multiple platforms has transformed financial industries, challenged policy and regulatory regimes, and reshaped the cultures of finance in China. The convergence paradigm underpins the digital, technology-driven logic facilitated by the state in resource allocation and policy-making. The government’s supportive role is a vital condition for the rise of Chinese fintech giants such as Baidu Finance, Ant Financial, Tencent Finance, and Jingdong Finance. © The Author 2018","China; convergence; fintech; fintech media; platform economy","","","","","","","","Some Simple Economics of Crowdfunding, (2013); Ahlers, Gerrit K.C., Signaling in Equity Crowdfunding, Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, 39, 4, pp. 955-980, (2015); We Will Keep Your Money Safe; Why Ant Financials Ipo is Hugely Anticipated, (2017); Belleflamme, Paul, The economics of crowdfunding platforms, Information Economics and Policy, 33, pp. 11-28, (2015); Bormann, Ernest G., Symbolic Convergence Theory: A Communication Formulation, Journal of Communication, 35, 4, pp. 128-138, (1985); Peers Inc how People and Platforms are Inventing the Collaborative Economy and Reinventing Capitalism, (2015); Platform Scale how an Emerging Business Model Helps Startups Build Large Empires with Minimum Investment, (2015); Matchmakers the New Economics of Multisided Platforms, (2016); Political Economy of Communication, (2018)","","","International Association of Media Communication Research","","","","","","","","","","English","Polit.

The multiple case studies examine topics such as: the adoption of online banking in Sweden; the identification and classification of different FinTech categories; process innovation developments within the traditional banking industry; and the Venture Capital (VC) landscape in Sweden, as shown through interviews with VC representatives, mainly from Sweden but also from the US and Germany, as well as offering insight into the companies that are currently operating in the FinTech arena in Sweden. The authors address questions such as: How will the regulatory landscape shape the future of FinTech companies? What are the factors that will likely drive the adoption of FinTech services in the future? What is the future role of banks in the context of FinTech and digitalization? What are the policies and government initiatives that aim to support the FinTech ecosystem in Sweden? Complex concepts and ideas are rendered in an easily digestible yet thought-provoking way. The book was initiated by the IIS (the Internet Foundation in Sweden), an independent organization promoting the positive development of the Internet in the country. It is also responsible for the Internet’s Swedish top-level domain .se, including the registration of domain names, and the administration and technical maintenance of the national domain name registry. The book illustrates how Sweden acts (or does not act) as a competitive player in the global FinTech arena, and is a vital addition to students and practitioners in the field. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Robin Teigland, Shahryar Siri, Anthony Larsson, Alejandro Moreno Puertas, and Claire Ingram Bogusz; individual chapters, the contributors.","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis","","","","","","","9781351183611; 9780815378501","","","English","The Rise and Development of FinTech: Accounts of Disruption from Sweden and Beyond","Book","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168436371"

Fintech may contribute to solutions by reinventing the business models. There are various players in the fintech universe: the old established incumbent banks, the completely fresh start-ups and the mega tech companies. The fintech regulatory framework in many countries is still new or under considerable development and may otherwise conflict with existing securities regulation. Islamic finance has an opportunity to expand by being at the cutting edge of such developments. Regulators are open to discussions about new ways of working; Islamic finance participants should grasp this opportunity. Most Muslim economists propose using profit/loss sharing as the favoured mode of finance and being as modest as possible even with the permissible debt modes. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Umar A.

Fintech is a new way of finance by providing innovative products that would improve existing practices and facilitate consumers’ experiences in transactions in an efficient and effective way. Fintech offers product innovation by structuring financial products that are new or significantly improved and enhanced with respect to their characteristics or intended uses. Innovation through fintech should be explored to emphasis the value proposition of Islamic finance such as how to use technology to ensure minimal risk in the musharakah and mudarabah models of financing or how istisna’a and salam can be operated and optimised using fintech. Fintech solutions should be guided by the broad principles of Shari‘ah by avoiding the prohibited elements in transactions, such as interest, gambling, uncertainty, harms, cheating.

It also discusses maqasid al-Shari‘ah and fintech and provides a maqasid theoretical framework necessary for developing the dimensions and elements for measuring the fintech solutions in Islamic finance. The chapter explores the various dimensions of the essential of mal in the literature, which can be categorised into three: Shari‘ah value proposition, development of mal and socio-economic welfare.

With the exception of a few books on fintech published in earlier years, most leading books on fintech were published in 2016 due to the novelty of the phenomenon. Fintech in Islamic finance should be generally understood in a broad manner as Islamic financial services transcend mere banking. For the purpose of identifying the applicable Shariah principles, it may be helpful to define fintech in its general sense and identify its different components and applications. One key aspect of fintech which is conspicuously missing in the ongoing discussions and application of fintech in Islamic financial services and products is online dispute resolution.

It considers how the regulation of technology usage in the financial services landscape is important to avoiding financial crime. The chapter also provides case studies from countries such as Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan, who are taking a lead in regulating fintech and digital currency usage. It examines an example from Malaysia to demonstrate how a central bank is taking the lead by issuing a fintech regulatory sandbox. Fintech powered by blockchain technology has huge importance for the financial services industry and can come in handy to solve problems such as delays, cost, duplication and reconciliation.

There may be a need for fintech-specific Shari‘ah and Shari‘ah-governance standards by the Islamic finance industry’s standard-setting bodies such as Accounting and Auditing Organisation for Islamic Financial Institutions and Islamic Financial Services Board. Shariah scholars, as well as the industry’s standard-setting bodies and freelancers, are expected to work towards surmounting the challenges of new developments in fintech solutions in Islamic finance. Islamic financial institutions can benefit from fintech by developing products that can be easily accessed by everyone in any part of the globe which should also be cost effective, for example, mobicash in Pakistan, M-pesa in Kenya and “TransferWise” in the United Kingdom.

It explains the opportunities and challenges for Islamic finance. The Islamic financial industry is young, highly technological and with the excess liquidity required to finance innovation. The Islamic finance industry has reacted more quickly than its conventional counterparts, in two fundamental areas; developing innovation in its own capacity and partnering with new Shari‘ah-compliant fintech ventures. Fintech offers a way whereby new technologies can help channel Islamic principles to create a new generation of financial products that can satisfy the demands of future generations.

The platform that leverages on the advance and innovative financial technology system, or fintech, offers a safe and regulated investment ecosystem with better outreach and enhanced visibility to the ventures while the investors enjoy a greater transparency and disclosure on the listed ventures. The introduction of an investment account under the Islamic Financial Services Act regime marked another stage in the evolution of the Malaysian Islamic banking industry. The platform facilitates direct investment by investors in viable projects just like other fintech platforms such as Peer-to-peer lending. IAP provides an innovative avenue for Islamic banks’ customers to earn higher investment returns with competitive tax incentives. The key difference between IAP and other technology-based fund-raising platforms lies in the intermediation roles played by the Islamic banks. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Umar A.

Financial intermediation based only on interest-rate mechanisms has obvious limitations as it hampers both investments and employment. The chapter shows that fintech-led financial intermediation would lead to better Shari‘ah compliance and address the issue of financial inclusion as well as better financing of small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) who have hitherto been unable to access mainstream financial market. Fintech is resolving both these issues of moral hazard and information asymmetry. Fintech-led newer marketplaces, like crowdfunding platforms, have enabled an opportunity and an access to capital to businesses/projects, especially the SMEs which would have been unable to do so in the traditional banking, are driven financial intermediation.

Although many researchers and practitioners believe that Fintech can reshape the future of the financial services industry, others are skeptical about the adoption of Fintech because of the considerable risks involved. Therefore, we need to better understand why users are willing or hesitant to adopt Fintech, wherein, positive and negative factors affect their adoption decision. Based on the net valence framework theoretically embedded in theory of reasoned action, we propose a benefit-risk framework which integrates positive and negative factors associated with its adoption. Based on the empirical data collected from 244 Fintech users, this study initially investigates whether perceived benefit and risk significantly impact Fintech adoption intention. We then examine whether the effect of perceived benefit and risk on Fintech adoption intention differs depending on the user types. Results show that legal risk has the biggest negative effect, whereas convenience has the strongest positive effect on Fintech adoption intention. The differences between early adopters and late adopters are driven by different factors. © 2018 IEEE Computer Society.

Our case study presents an example of an Australian FinTech organisation, which has successfully applied Extreme Programming method as their company-wide risk management strategy tool. The Agile methods application encompasses the different layers of risk management; method, people and process. This study discusses how Agile development method practices are utilised to respond to risks and to ensure compliance. The case organisation is shown to address both the regulatory requirements as well as fulfil the bases for risk management approach and tailoring frameworks proposed in the literature. Finally, we present a theory of strategic risk management via Agile methods. This theory illustrates how method application influences other aspects of strategic risk management. © 2018 Association for Information Systems.

The digital revolution in financial services is under way, and digital disruption has the potential to shrink the role and relevance of today’s banks, while simultaneously creating better, faster, cheaper services that will be an essential part of everyday life. This forward-looking book discusses the crucial innovation, structural and institutional development for financial technologies (fintech) in Islamic finance. The authors explain concepts in fintech and blockchain technology and follow through with their applications, challenges and evolving nature. The book provides insights into technology which will enable and enhance actual prescribed Islamic behaviors in modern economic transactions. Case studies highlight how to cope with modern transactional behavior with the advent of global online/mobile markets, shorter attention spans, and impersonal trade exchange. © 2019 Hazik Mohamed and Hassnian Ali.","Blockchain; Fintech; Islamic economics; Islamic finance; Shari’ah","","","","","","","","Aldridge, Irene, Real-Time Risk: What Investors Should Know About FinTech, High-Frequency Trading, and Flash Crashes, pp. 1-212, (2017); Knowledge Management in Digital Change New Findings and Practical Cases, (2018); Boland, Richard J., Wakes of innovation in project networks: The case of digital 3-D representations in architecture, engineering, and construction, Organization Science, 18, 4, pp. 631-647, (2007); Journal of Financial Transformation, (2016); Racing from Digital Engagement to Customer Intimacy, (2016); Digital Transformation in Banking and Financial Services, (2018); Liere-Netheler, Kirsten, Drivers of digital transformation in manufacturing, Proceedings of the Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 2018-January, pp. 3926-3935, (2018); Journal of Service Management Research, (2018); Micic, Ljubisa S., Digital Transformation and Its Influence on GDP, ECONOMICS - Innovative and Economics Research Journal, 5, 2, pp. 135-147, (2017); Digital Transformation in Financial Services, (2017)","","","De Gruyter","","","","","","","9781547400966; 9781547417124","","","English","Blockchain, Fintech, and Islamic Finance: Building the Future in the New Islamic Digital Economy","Book","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083896474"

Fin-tech itself can be described as an industry composed of companies using a new tech-nology and innovation with available resources in order to compete in the marketplace of tradi-tional financial institutions and intermediaries in the delivery of financial services. In Indonesia, Fin-tech has been widely developed since the past 3 years. Fin-tech faces a new challenge as a new service for financial consumer which adapts to new ways of living in modern digital tech-nology era. Basically, Fin-tech offers three main categories such as payment, personal finance, and financing. In financing application there are peer to peer financing, social crowd funding, and loan marketplace. All of these kinds of application have some issues in legal framework and data protection due to the use of communication technologies such as internet, social networks, Smartphone, massive use of data with the Big Data, connected objects, etc. The use of big data and those new technologies create new opportunities for these sectors, and this development also raises significant data protection concerns. This paper discusses two legal issues of Fin-tech, the legal aspect, and the data protection. © 2018 Sriwijaya University.

In order to realize a cashless society, each country adopts mobile payment method as its main policy objective. It is actively promoting regulations and alleviating regulations. This is a very important task. Since the mobile easy payment services are still in the infancy phase, it is being investigated that the acceptance rate among the layers is various. Through previous researches, it was confirmed that the most important factor affecting the intention of using mobile easy payment service was perceived usefulness, and the factors influencing perceived usefulness were classified as personal characteristics, service characteristics, environmental characteristics and service characteristics. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether people with experience using mobile easy payment service will continue to use the service in the future and what factors influence the intention to use the service continuously. The results of the study showed that the variables of personal characteristics and service characteristics influenced the intention to use continuously in the future through perceived usefulness. In addition, it has been found that the various gaps between the layers are important factors in the future intention of mobile payment service. According to the results of this study, the important national task in spreading mobile payment service is suggesting that how to resolve the smart divide and the income gap is an important policy task. © 2018 SERSC Australia.","FinTech; Income divide; Mobile easy payment service; Smart divide; TAM","","","","","","","","Davis, Fred D., Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and user acceptance of information technology, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 13, 3, pp. 319-339, (1989); Diffusion of Innovations, (1995); Bandura, Albert, Self-efficacy: Toward a unifying theory of behavioral change, Psychological Review, 84, 2, pp. 191-215, (1977); Thompson, Ronald L., Personal computing: Toward a conceptual model of utilization, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 15, 1, pp. 125-142, (1991); Pham, Thanh Thao T., The effects of product-related, personal-related factors and attractiveness of alternatives on consumer adoption of NFC-based mobile payments, Technology in Society, 43, pp. 159-172, (2015); Journal of Marketing Research, (1981); Multivariate Data Analysis, (1998); Davis, Fred D., User acceptance of information technology: system characteristics, user perceptions and behavioral impacts, International Journal of Man-Machine Studies, 38, 3, pp. 475-487, (1993); Asia Pacific Journal of Convergent Research Interchange, (2015); Asiapacific Journal of Convergent Research Interchange Hsst, (2015)","K.S.

The endowment appears to be a direct translation from equivalent documents to be found in the Islamic world at the time. Islamic finance was too niche for them to deploy precious legal and compliance personnel at a time of increased regulatory scrutiny. International banks that once operated dedicated Islamic finance teams have substantially disbanded those teams. Fintech has the advantage of democratising the provision of finance, disrupting the standard business models of banks and allowing for risk-sharing asset classes to emerge, all three of which are lacking in the present-day model of Islamic banking. Fintech platforms are often able to short-circuit the challenges of contract standardisation and therefore, by association, that of Shari‘ah compliance faced by banks. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Umar A.

In order to enhance the market efficiency and liquidity, the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) has granted Thai stock brokers permission to develop and offer their customers algorithm and automatic stock trading. However, algorithm trading on SET was not widely adopted. This chapter intends to design and empirically estimate a model in explaining Thai investors’ acceptance of algorithm trading. The theoretical framework is based on the theory of reasoned action and technology acceptance model (TAM). A sample of 400 investors who have used online stock trading and 300 investors who have used algorithm stock trading were observed and analyzed using structural equations model (SEM) and generalized linear regression model (GLM) with a Logit specification. The results confirm that attitudes, subjective norm, perceived risks, and trust toward algorithm stock trading are factors determining investors’ behavior and acceptance of using algorithm stock trading. Investor’s perception and trust on algorithm stock trading as a trading strategy is a major factor in determining their perceived behavior and control, which affect their decision on whether to invest using algorithm trading. Accordingly, it can be concluded that Thai investors is willing to accept algorithm trading as a new financial technology, but still has concern about the reliability and profitable of this new stock trading strategy. Therefore, algorithm trading can be promoted by building inves-tors’ trust on algorithm trading as a reliable and profitable trading strategy. © 2018 by Emerald Publishing Limited.

It identifies FinTech’s evolution in Asia across Deposits & lending, Capital Raising, Investment Management, Market provisioning, Payments, and Insurance. This technology revolution allows us to have a banking system based on values that serve customers better, reduce risk to the society and improve returns for the shareholders. Data on unbanked population, smartphone penetration, and Internet penetration has led to retail side innovations such as Mobile Wallets, P2P Payments, and Real-time Payments in the most of Asia (except China). A total of 49% of Global Investments in FinTech are in Asia and the Chinese dragon alone accounts for 46%. India is witnessing a strong amount of FinTech deals in 2017 and it is being driven by payment and lending solutions. ASEAN FinTech industry is dominated by m-wallets and online payments; this is followed by retail investment and financial comparison. The chapter dives into the challenges Asian banks are facing because of this disruption. Now more than ever, is the important role governments and central banks of each nation play to assess the path these start-ups are headed on and this will unfold the landscape of banking in Asia a few years down the lane. © 2018 by Emerald Publishing Limited.

Promotion of the digital economy in the financial sector is a high-priority task for the short-term perspective. Nicholas Negroponte, an American scientist, first used the concept of “digital economy” in 1995. Since then, this concept has started spreading rapidly with the help of the Internet and has enhanced exchange and storage of information, complex calculations, and computer modeling of engineering facilities. In the new economy, digital platforms are the most open electronic platforms that allow receiving full information about financial institutions and organizations; they are also being developed primarily for the financial sector. The introduction of digital technologies can lead to the reduction of headcount of financial institutions.

The paper describes features and characteristics of contemporary Russian fintech landscape and ecosystem. The examples of innovative financial services in Russia, including online banking and accounting, new payments and transfers services, platforms for crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending, blockchain initiatives, etc. are discussed. It is shown that fintech initiatives have not yet led to a radical transformation of the financial sector in Russia because participants of the fintech ecosystem have different points of view on fintech. Russian banks are now developing fintech initiatives within themselves, encouraging technology companies and fintech startups to focus their efforts on innovations that are aimed at improving processes, rather than opening new markets. The Government directs the main efforts to initiatives related to regulation of cryptocurrencies circulation and to introduction of blockchain in regtech and cybersecurity. Customers are interested in new and more convenient functionality in mobile applications, and they are waiting for new value propositions, including fast international money transfers, roboadvising, personal financial management, peer-to-peer lending. © 2018 Vladimir I.

At the same time, the existing regulatory mechanisms and legislation do not create optimal conditions for the development of the market of new financial instruments and technologies in Russia today. There are socio-economic risks, the key ones including an increase in the outflow of capital and innovative projects to other countries, a lack of confidence on the part of potential investors in new financial instruments, a decrease in the stability of traditional financial institutions. On this basis, the following tasks have been set in this article. To consider the terminology in the field of digital economy from the theoretical aspect; to identify trends and justify the need for digitalization of economic processes based on the use of new financial technologies; to reveal the informative characteristics of financial technologies promising for Russia.

The disruption is in the form of loan distribution and profits gained by incumbent firms' business. This study is a pioneer study investigating the impact of fintech startups on incumbent firms' performance. Incumbent firms involved in this study are rural bank, commercial bank, and multi-finance institutions which principally run peer-to-peer lending business. Loan distribution was assessed by employing net loan to assets while profit was assessed by employing return on assets. This study was conducted in Indonesia by involving all incumbent firms registered in Indonesia Stock Exchange and Financial Service Authority. This study employed paired sample t-test to examine if net loans to assets and return on assets received differences before and after fintech startup emerged. The study reveals that fintech startup disrupts incumbent firms' business because incumbent firms' total of net loans to assets and total of return on assets decrease. However, this condition only occurs in rural bank and multi-finance institutions. Business threat of fintech startup does not occur in commercial bank. © © 2018 International Business Information Management Association (IBIMA).","Fintech; Incumbent firm; Performance; Startup","Information management; Profitability; Reactor startup; Financial service authorities; Fintech; Firms' performance; Incumbent firm; Paired-sample t-test; Peer-to-peer lending; Performance; Technology start-up; Finance","","","","","","","Ács, Zoltán J., Introduction: The startup process, Estudios de Economia, 35, 2, pp. 121-132, (2008); Alt, Rainer, The rise of customer-oriented banking - Electronic markets are paving the way for change in the financial industry, Electronic Markets, 22, 4, pp. 203-215, (2012); Georgetown Journal of International Law, (2015); Buchak, Greg, Fintech, regulatory arbitrage, and the rise of shadow banks, Journal of Financial Economics, 130, 3, pp. 453-483, (2018); Journal of Financial Transformation, (2016); Innovator S Dilemma When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail, (1997); Harvard Business Review, (2015); Chishti, Susanne, How peer to peer lending and crowdfunding drive the fintech revolution in the UK, New Economic Windows, pp. 55-68, (2016); Cramer, Judd N.L., Disruptive change in the taxi business: The case of uber, American Economic Review, 106, 5, pp. 177-182, (2016); International Journal of Economics Commerce and Management, (2017)","A.

The preliminary results suggest that professionals with financial job title or work experiences in finance industry are more likely to switch to a FinTech job. Meanwhile, the finance or computing major also has a positive effect on switching to a FinTech job. Further analysis shows that FinTech professionals in FinTech startups and FinTech incumbent firms exhibit significant different human capital characteristics, which indicates that startups put more attention to IT workers's leadership and prior startup experience while FinTech incumbent firms focus more on IT techniques and IT educational background when hiring employees. More interestingly, both of the FinTech startups and incumbent firms prefer hiring professionals with either specialized finance or computing background rather than those with both financial and computing backgrounds. Our findings are expected to have important implications for both researchers and practitioners. © International Conference on Information Systems 2018, ICIS 2018.All rights reserved.","FinTech incumbent firm; FinTech job; FinTech startup; IT professional; LinkedIn","Employment; Information systems; Information use; Personnel training; Social networking (online); Computing majors; Education training; Finance industries; FinTech incumbent firm; FinTech job; Information technology professionals; IT professional; LinkedIn; Finance","","","","","","","Ahlers, Gerrit K.C., Signaling in Equity Crowdfunding, Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, 39, 4, pp. 955-980, (2015); Belleflamme, Paul, Crowdfunding: Tapping the right crowd, Journal of Business Venturing, 29, 5, pp. 585-609, (2014); Fintech Regulatory Arbitrage and the Rise of Shadow Banks, (2017); Dencker, John C., Individual and opportunity factors influencing job creation in new firms, Academy of Management Journal, 52, 6, pp. 1125-1147, (2009); Journal of Information Systems Education, (2008); Gallagher, Kevin P., The requisite variety of skills for IT professionals, Communications of the ACM, 53, 6, pp. 144-148, (2010); Gallivan, Michael J., Examining IT Professionals’ Adaptation to Technological Change: The Influence of Gender and Personal Attributes, Data Base for Advances in Information Systems, 35, 3, pp. 28-49, (2004); Ge, Chunmian, Engineer/scientist careers: Patents, online profiles, and misclassification bias, Strategic Management Journal, 37, 1, pp. 232-253, (2016); Gomber, Peter, Digital Finance and FinTech: current research and future research directions, Journal of Business Economics, 87, 5, pp. 537-580, (2017); Huang, Allen H., Analyst information discovery and interpretation roles: A topic modeling approach, Management Science, 64, 6, pp. 2833-2855, (2018)","","","Association for Information Systems publications@aisnet.org","Auburn University; et al.; Georgia State University, J.

The expansion of FinTech industry has encouraged the use of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. A study has been conducted to assess the blockchain, cryptocurrency and FinTech market growth. This paper provides empirical evidence on the factors influencing the market growth in Malaysia and highlights the factors that could spur and hinder its future use. A survey of 304 blockchain users and industry players in Malaysia was conducted and quantitative results revealed that privacy is the most significant barrier to the adoption of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency ecosystem. Other barriers include those related to legality, cost, security, and stability, as well as difficulties in switching to a new technology. Thus, government regulation is needed to provide guidelines for ensuring the sustainability and growth of this technology in the near future. In addition, results demonstrate that the banking sector is going to be the most affected by the FinTech industry. This current trend may assist the decision makers in evaluating the potential usage of this technology, allowing them to make strategic decisions to improve business and services. © 2018, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

New financial technologies have already attracted many investors and form millions of budgets. Changing the traditional financial services concept, FinTech companies formed a new niche within the financial services market, the dynamic development of which determines the relevance of the development and implementation of an effective regulatory and oversight system. The purpose of the article is to develop an economic and mathematical model for forecasting the development of the FinTech market on the example of Ukraine. In order to study the development of the FinTech industry, a multiple regression model was presented. The model describes the dependence of the total investment value of FinTech from venture investments in financial technology, venture investments in other technologies and venture investments in online lending. Based on this model, the effect of attracting investments with new FinTech projects on the total volume of investments in the industry was clarified. According to the model, with a change in investments in FinTech by 1%, the total rate of venture investments decreases by 0.03, funds in new projects of other companies grow by 0.05, and venture investments in online lending increase by 0.89. According to the analysis of regulatory legislation in the foreign countries of the FinTech services sphere, it was found that the regulation of most of the risks associated with the development of FinTech services falls within the competence of different supervisory authorities, requiring cross-sectoral cooperation between public institutions. © Limited Liability Company","Digital finance; Financial services market; Financial supervision; Financial technologies; FinTech; InsurTech; Investment","","","","","","","","Real Estate Market in Armenia, (2018); Global Charts; Vision 2020 for Fintech and Non Bank Regulation, (2017); Marketplace Lending Fintech in Consumer and Small Business Lending, (2018); Insurthech Entering Its Second Wave, (2018); Armenian ICT Sector Enterprise Incubator Foundation, (2017); Future of Fintech and Financial Services, (2018); Global Insurance M A Themes, (2017); undefined; Supervisory Insight, (2015)","","","LLC CPC Business Perspectives","","","","","","18142427","","","","English","Innov.

However, a better understanding of these types and roles is required for incumbent as well as for new actors for defining and aligning their strategies. In this paper, we analyze the business models of 195 fintech companies with a special focus on the role of data. Based on this analysis, we present a structured overview of fintechs’ business areas as well as six data-related business model types.

The paper identifies disruptive challenges for financial institutions need to adapt. The research investigates the value and the investment flows structure as most obvious indicators of FinTech and describes types of payments relationships there. The paper considers relationships between enterprises, financial institutions and individuals, which are formed in digital payments. To understand the difference between regular cross-border money transfers and P2P crossborder money transfers with TransferWise, both mechanisms were researched and the benefits underlined. For Ukraine, the improvement of existing cross-border payments system with FinTech is a crucial challenge. That is why it is important to focus on providing knowledge for people, supporting start-ups in the sector and learning the best implementation practices. A great example of cross-border payments of FinTech in Ukraine is TransferWise. The difference between regular cross-border money transfers and peer-to-peer (P2P) money transfers appears in its benefits, such as lower and more expectable transfer fee, mid-market exchange rate, less transaction period. By transforming existing cost structures and mitigating market imperfections, they provide innovative services that meet the users' needs for speed, trust, low cost, usability, security and transparency. The results show high potential of FinTech for cross-border payment processing. © Yuriy Petrushenko.","Digital economy; Financial innovations; Financial services; Financial sphere; Financial technologies; Payment methods; Start-up; Venture","","","","","","","","Top 10 Trends in Financial Services, (2017); Evolution of Fintech A New Post Crisis Paradigm, (2015); undefined, (2018); Innovation in Payments the Future is Fintech, (2015); World Fintech Report, (2017); Top 10 Trends in Banking, (2017); Blockchain Services and Solutions Comprehensive Offerings to Guide Your Blockchain Journey, (2016); Fintech and Financial Services Initial Considerations, (2017); Ecb to Develop A Service for the Settlement of Instant Payments, (2018); Payment Services Psd 2 Directive Eu 2015 2366, (2017)","","","LLC CPC Business Perspectives","","","","","","18104967","","","","English","Investm.

Hence, it is the task of this book to shed light on the introduction and trends in FinTech, blockchain and token sales. Richly illustrated with original lecture slides taught by the authors, Inclusive FinTech: Blockchain, Cryptocurrency and ICO hopes to dispel the many misconceptions about blockchain and cryptocurrencies (especially bitcoin, Initial Crypto-Token Offering or ICO), as well as the idea that businesses can be sustainable without a social dimension going forward. With comprehensive coverage given to the FinTech scene in Asia, it is targeted at those who are searching for business opportunities.

In particular, some typical examples of applying blockchain in Financial Technology (FinTech) are discussed, including such as applying Bitcoin to drive various new business services, and implementing smart contracts based on blockchain technology to oversee the execution of legal transactions in real time. In addition, a pioneer effort of building up a distributed-ledger consortium model is addressed in the near future work. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.","","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Bitcoin; Business agreement; Business Process; Business service; Financial services industries; ITS applications; Real time; Smart contracts; Blockchain","","","","","","","Merkle, Ralph C., A digital signature based on a conventional encryption function, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 293 LNCS, pp. 369-378, (1988); Consulted, (2008); Economist, (2001); Beyond the Buzz Exploring Distributed Ledger Technology Use Cases in Capital Markets and Corporate Banking; Taylor, Michael Bedford, The evolution of bitcoin hardware, Computer, 50, 9, pp. 58-66, (2017); Magazzeni, Daniele, Validation and verification of smart contracts: A research agenda, Computer, 50, 9, pp. 50-57, (2017); Khan, Chris, A Distributed-Ledger Consortium Model for Collaborative Innovation, Computer, 50, 9, pp. 29-37, (2017); undefined; Torproject; Bitcoin and the Ppp Puzzle","W.

Examples include internet banking, mobile payments, crowdfunding, robo-advice and virtual currencies. These applications show that the digital revolution is irreversibly changing the way people live, including the way they interact with the financial system. The rapidly growing FinTech sector has its rewards and challenges (e.g. data and consumer protection issues, risk of exacerbating financial volatility and cybercrime) and has been increasingly attracting political attention at the supranational level. Thus, the fundamental question of this paper is: how is the European Union dealing with FinTech? Due to the broad scope of FinTech, EU regulators face a dilemma: on the one hand, rule-based regulatory frameworks set out compliance obligations clearly, but these are often expensive from a start-up perspective and could be an obstacle to innovation and job creation. On the other hand, principle-based regulation is more flexible, but could create some uncertainty as to what exactly is expected in terms of compliance. A possible middle ground could be found by evolving towards a more dialectic supervisory model. © 2018 Fondazione Gerardo Capriglione Onlus.

So-called ‘Fintech disruptors’ are aggressively tapping into their service delivery chain to offer clients a better (cheaper, more convenient or efficient) value proposition. As banks have subsequently been forced to think more strategically about how to conduct themselves due to the imminent use of, for example, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, biometrics and big data, regulators have simultaneously had to ensure that the pervasiveness of technological disruption does not threaten the soundness of banks and the stability of economies. Aim: To identify the strategic implications of Fintech on South African retail banks. Setting: The study is conducted in the South African retail banking industry. Methods: A post-positivist paradigm approach that is qualitative in nature. Results: There are several main findings: firstly, technology-based skills are becoming mandatory for staff and regulators alike; secondly, interaction policy is migrating clients towards a remote-based distribution strategy; thirdly, the bank of the future will not rely as heavily on brick-and-mortar branches as it has in the past; fourthly, new competitors are entering the fray and offer competitive digital-only solutions; finally, given the innovation and growth shown by these disruptors, financial sector regulators will have to find ways to hold them accountable. Conclusion: By adapting to the Fintech revolution, South African retail banks are hoping to become strategically pre-emptive rather than merely proactive. This will allow them not only to identify opportunities first, but also to offer solutions before competitors are able to do either of these. © 2018.

Part of the disadvantaged and low-income segments of global population is left without (i.e. financially excluded) or very limited access (i.e. financially underserved) to basic financial services, creating a highly critical equality deficit in different parts of the world. In this frame of reference, financial exclusion still remains a highly critical problem that hinders developing regions around the world from eradicating poverty leading to large-scale starvation and civil unrest. Moreover, financial exclusion is interwoven with social dependency making financially excluded/underserved populations strongly dependable on their social networks. The emergence of FinTech, the new breed between financial innovation and financial technology, which has been challenging the prevailing position of incumbent financial institutions, is providing a promising vehicle of tackling this phenomenon by closing the gap between unbanked, under-banked and developed societies, opening the door to the global digital economy, bringing a long-term societal transformational change for the financially excluded/underserved, while leading to inclusive economic growth helping move towards a more just and equitable society. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In the meantime, the digital finance boom has created serious concerns and challenges for Chinese regulators in relation to issues such as financial stability, consumer protection, illegal financial activities, etc. To address these issues, the Chinese government has committed to develop a comprehensive framework for the regulation and supervision of DFS and has taken a balanced approach whereby the promotion of DFS will continue under such a framework so as to ensure the sustainable development of DFS.

As new platforms and technologies are introduced to the market, and the boundaries of traditional business models are challenged, financial services can be provided with greater accountability, efficiency and accessibility. Ant Financial, China's largest Fintech company in the making, is set to revolutionize the China's financial network, including payment, wealth management and loans. It focuses on the underserved markets by the major Chinese banks: the low-income individuals, especially those in the rural areas. Ant Financial has leveraged on Taobao's platform, along with Alibaba's rural Taobao Strategy, to give out loans and help traditional agricultural business to set up shops on Taobao. Alibaba also introduced Taobao rural service centers, where villagers can get accustomed to making purchases and paying bills online, as well as picking up items they bought on Taobao. Alibaba provides computers and trains villagers to serve as its representatives in the centers, which are often in convenience stores. With Fintech advancements, access to products and financial services is becoming more accessible than ever. Ensuring a level playing field for consumers that live in rural locations or regions without the structures of an urban economy is vital in achieving full financial and social inclusion. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This article defines SocialTech as organizations that represent the intersection between Social Enterprises and Fintech. As Fintech's classifications exclude the social dimension and categorizations of social entrepreneurship activities exclude the dimension of technology, we propose a SocialTech classification that considers both technological aspects and social entrepreneurship activity.

As the battle over the Chinese mobile wallet market wages on, the gap between leading players WeChat Pay (owned by Tencent) and Alipay remains narrow. Based on brand equity theory and symbolic value theory, a research model is proposed to investigate the relationship between Fintech's technology leadership, brand equity, and customer loyalty. The results show that Alipay provides more innovative and diversified financial services and outperforms WeChat Pay in technology leadership. The study confirms that technology leadership positively affects brand equity, which in turn positively affects customer loyalty. The boundary condition for different type of customers is considered and implications for theory and practice are also discussed. © 2018 Association for Information Systems.

The authors defined the main features of FinTech platforms underlining types of FinTech, its participants and the most influential factors. The main trends of FinTech platforms development in the EU countries, such as the level of investment, impact of EU FinTech platforms on the global scale, features of investments into B2B FinTech, were determined. It was considered that in Ukraine, some positive changes in legislation were adopted, but the challenges like lack of finance, slow adoption of innovations in the financial market, not sufficient clarity of legislation remain among the main constraints for further development of FinTech platforms in Ukraine. The conducted analysis on the level of FinTech types performance by Ukrainian platforms showed only the great share of digital payments and money transfers, while other modern innovative FinTech instruments should not be underestimated for proper FinTech application in Ukraine. For this purpose, the authors have developed the Information Platform on Support for SMEs’ Innovations that consolidates interests of both SMEs and scientists. To determine both the SMEs’ opinion about the necessity of a particular Internet platform for them and the types of services that could be provided by the sme-sci.com platform, the authors conducted a survey in which 374 medium-sized and 380 small businesses took part. The results of the survey that are presented in the article confirm the necessity of the Information Platform on Support for SMEs’ Innovations and demand for it from the SMEs. Finally, the result of the research proves that such a unique informational platform as sme-sci. com that will serve as an interactive field for exchanging ideas and information of both representatives of scientific and business world is of great importance. © Alla Ivashchenko, Igor Britchenko, Mykhailo Dyba, Yevheniia Polishchuk, Yuliia Sybirianska, Yurii Vasylyshen, 2018","Crowdfunding; Equity funding; FinTech platforms; Information platforms; New technologies; P2P lending","","","","","","Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine, MESU","As a result of implementation of the young scholars’ research project “The new paradigm of financial support of innovations in small and medium enterprises” (it is funded by the Ministry of Science of Ukraine), the Information Platform on Support for SME Innovation (sme-sci.com) was developed.

The proposed genetic model transmits information to future generations in the network weights rather than the neurons. The innovative genetic algorithm is implanted in a complex deep learning structure that emulates the human brain: Reinforcement Learning takes fast local current decisions, Deep Learning Clusters provide identity and memory, Deep Learning Management Clusters take final strategic decisions and finally Genetic Learning transmits the information learned to future generations. This proposed structure has been applied and validated in Fintech; a Smart Investment application: an Intelligent Banker that performs Buy and Sell decisions on several Assets with an associated market and risk.

This consequently puts the financial services industry under additional pressure and constant growing competition from the financial sector participants, from large technology companies such as Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, from large FinTech companies such as PayPal, Moven, TransferWise, mobile network operators and other existing and potential market players. The implementation of the new EU Payment Service Directive (PSD2), which allows non-financial companies to provide access to financial services for bank customers, is expected to disrupt the financial services industry as we know it, and make traditional financial services providers and banks, in particular, think of new creative business models to remain competitive. In the process of doing this, changing the landscape of payments and creating new risks for banking business. With this study we aim to assess the new EU Payment Service regulation in the context of industry competitiveness. The study is based on the examination of the PSD2 Directive exploring the opportunities as well as the risks that it will bring to this industry in the near future, and the possibilities of cooperation of the financial services industry with financial technology developers. Moreover, we analyse structured data, collected from a questionnaire based on 4 themes of perception of techs on the importance they have on ensuring competitiveness, conducted with European tech companies. Most of the questionnaire participants believe that the Payment Services Directive 2 will promote competitiveness, innovations and development. Moreover, findings show that comparativeness is related mainly to low costs and customer satisfaction. However, it is also shown that high quality of products/services as well as relatively high speed of transactions and security, privacy and risk are also perceived as important. © 2018 International Strategic Management Association.

The empirical study is based on the analysis of the information reported by companies included in two FinTech top-list. Thus, the sample includes 91 businesses from Europe, Asia and North America. The results of the indices indicate that the total volume of information provided on the website is less than the amount reported in other sectors and other type of businesses.

Yet unlike in other digital arenas in which American companies are global leaders, such as search engines and ride hailing, the United States lags in consumer financial technology. This Article posits that the current competition policy framework is holding back consumer financial innovation. It then identifies a contributor missing from the literature: the institutional design of federal regulators. Competition authority-including antitrust and the extension of business licenses-is spread across at least five agencies. Each is focused on other missions or industries. The Department of Justice (DOJ), hindered by statutes and knowledge gaps, devotes significantly fewer resources to banking than to other industries in merger review because it leans heavily on prudential regulators. The Federal Reserve and other prudential regulators prioritize financial stability, which conflicts with their competition mandate. No agency has the right authority, motivation, and expertise to promote consumer financial competition. Innovation has raised the stakes for fixing this structural flaw in finance, and potentially in other heavily regulated industries. If allowed to compete fully, financial technology challengers (""fintechs"") could bring large consumer welfare advances and reduce the size of ""Too Big to Fail"" banks, thereby lessening the chances of a financial crisis. If allowed to grow unchecked, fintechs or the big banks acquiring them may reach the kind of digital market dominance seen in Google, Facebook, and Amazon, thereby increasing systemic risk. Whether the goal is to benefit consumers, strengthen markets, or prevent crises, a reallocation of competition authority would better position regulators to navigate the future of innovation. © 2018 American Statistical Association.

The advancement of mobile devices and their usage have increased the uptake of financial technology (FinTech) innovation. Financial sectors and startups see FinTech as a gateway to increase business opportunities, but mobile applications and other technology platforms must be launched to explore such opportunities. Mobile application security threats have increased tremendously and have become a challenge for both users and FinTech innovators. In this paper, the authors empirically inspect the components that influence the expectations of both users and organizations to adopt FinTech, such as customer trust, data security, value added, user interface design and FinTech promotion. The empirical results definitely confirm that data security, customer trust and the user design interface affect the adoption of FinTech. Existing studies have used the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to address this issue. The outcomes of this study can be used to improve the performance of FinTech strategies and enable banks to achieve economies of scale for global intensity. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the authors empirically consider factors that influence the expectations of both users and organizations in adopting FinTech, such as customer trust, data security, value added, the user design interface and FinTech promotion. The results confirm that customer trust, data security and the user design interface affect the adoption of FinTech. This research proposes a model called “Intention to adopt FinTech in Germany,” constructs of which were developed based on the TAM and five additional components, as identified. The outcomes of this study can be used to improve the performance of FinTech strategies and enable banks to achieve economies of scale for global intensity. Findings: The authors demonstrated that the number of mobile users in Germany is rapidly increasing; yet the adoption of FinTech is extremely sluggish. It is intriguing to reckon that 99 per cent of respondents had mobile devices, but only 10 per cent recognized FinTech. Further, it is significantly discouraging to perceive that only 10 of the 209 respondents had ever used FinTech services, representing under 1 per cent of the surveyed respondents. It is obvious that the FinTech incubators and banks offering FinTech services need to persuade their customers regarding the usefulness and value added advantages of FinTech. This study has been carried out to determine the key factors that influence and provoke FinTech adoption. Research limitations/implications: There are a few limitations in this study. Initially, this study focuses on FinTech implementation in Germany and not the whole of Europe. In addition, demographic and regional factors could be consolidated to inspect their particular impact on the intention to use FinTech services, particularly among younger users with a high interest in technology. Without these constraints, the authors could have gathered additional data for a more robust result and obtained new knowledge to further upgrade polices to enhance the FinTech adoption process. Future analysts can assist exploration of this topic by altering determinants in the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology model. Additionally, because the cluster sampling technique was used, the reported outcomes are not 100 per cent generalized to the German population. To accomplish a complete generalization, a basic random sampling strategy for the whole population is essential. The authors could also alleviate some limitations by examining how online vendors are performing with regard to FinTech to satisfy the needs of customers via case studies. Practical implications: This study was conducted in Germany and might have produced different results if held in other countries, as technology acceptance is different in a different environment. For instance, the authors suspect that the results would be somewhat different, were the research to be conducted in the United Kingdom, where take-up of FinTech appears to be far greater than in Germany. Therefore, the authors’ results are only generalized for the country of Germany and not other geographical areas. Furthermore, respondents may have been influenced by past experiences about FinTech usage which might have led them to neglect to answer some questions. In spite of this, this study did not consider the influence of moderating variables such as age, education and FinTech services experience. The authors also neglected social impact and control factors, as their corresponding items disregarded the instrument dependability. Accordingly, the authors could not quantify social impact and control factors on FinTech use. Social implications: The outcomes of this study can be used to improve the performance of FinTech strategies and enable banks to accomplish economies of scale for global intensity. The authors do hope that this paper will serve to encourage FinTech innovators in their approach to FinTech and enable FinTech researchers to use past work with more prominent certainty, resulting in rigid hypothesis improvement in the future. Originality/value: A considerable amount of revenue has been invested in the information technology (IT) infrastructure of banks to enhance their performance, but investment in IT remains a substantial risk regarding the return on investment (Carlson, 2015). Most banks and financial organizations around the globe are engaging in an extreme pressure from their customers and competitors to enhance IT. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cyber security; Data security; FinTech; Information security; Mobile banking","Customer satisfaction; Economics; Finance; Investments; Mobile computing; Mobile devices; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Sales; Security of data; User interfaces; Cyber security; Design/methodology/approach; FinTech; Information technology infrastructure; Mobile application securities; Mobile bankings; Technology acceptance model; Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology; Economic and social effects","","","","","","","Ajzen, Icek, The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); Understanding Attitudes and Predicting Social Behavior, (1980); Introduction to Measurement Theory, (1979); Journal of Information Technology Management, (2009); Anderson, James C., Structural Equation Modeling in Practice: A Review and Recommended Two-Step Approach, Psychological Bulletin, 103, 3, pp. 411-423, (1988); Boyd, Bill W E, Quantitative and qualitative approaches to research in environmental management, Australasian Journal of Environmental Management, 13, 2, pp. 70-78, (2006); Trustbuilders and Trustbusters the Role of Trust Cues in Interface to E Commerce Applications, (2001); Bland, John Martin Artin, Statistics notes: Cronbach's alpha, BMJ, 314, 7080, (1997); Practice of Nursing Research Conduct Critique and Utilization, (2001); Testimony on Behalf of the Fin Servs Information Sharing Analysis Ctr Fs Isac Before the US House of Rep, (2015)","H.

The purpose of the paper is to investigate how financial services industry participants perceive the effect of digital disruption as well as to explore what strategies are being adopted by incumbents in the face of potential disruption from fintech challengers. Based on an exploratory study with stakeholders from the financial ecosystem in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), the findings show that the fintech sector is still nascent, but is likely to be disruptive in selected product and customer segments. Multiple regulatory, structural, and cultural obstacles stand in the way of fintech adoption. Incumbents’ preferred strategy to face the future disruption is the bank-fintech collaboration, which will create new value for ecosystem partners and speed up innovation. Our study adds useful insights to the body of knowledge related to disruptive innovations in general and fintech in emerging markets in particular. Specifically, the collaborative response is inconsistent with the strategies usually recommended for incumbents in disruptive innovation theory. We hypothesize that our participants’ preference for partnering can be explained in the light of the distinctive characteristics of the digital economy.

Subsequent work primarily focused on the cryptocurrency, bitcoin, because its creator, programmer Satoshi Nakamoto first published a white paper and coded what is now known as blockchain technology to solve the double spending problem. More recently, Blockchain Technology has made significant advances in the fields of insurance, medical records, and the internet of things (IoT). However, the power of Blockchain Technology to solve problems in and serve as a replacement ledger of transactions in Financial Services will fundamentally transform the finance industry. This paper attempts to address the challenges that Blockchain Technology will encounter by focusing on the methodology of using Blockchain Technology to solve problems in the Financial Services Market with special attention to the use of Decentralization and Peer-to-Peer Transactions. Specifically, this project will be examining the use of Blockchain Technology to drive the changes in the field of Financial Services. This paper will also discuss the future role of Blockchain Technology in teaching the various fields of Finance, and juxtapose them against traditional teaching methods in Finance, in order to reveal the increasing role that Blockchain Technology will play in the 21st-century Financial Services curriculum. This paper argues that indeed, Blockchain Technology will be able to increasingly affect how we solve various Financial Services problems and that this development will profoundly change the way the Finance curriculum is taught in the classroom. In conclusion, this project, by closely examining the role of Blockchain Technology, sheds new light on the rapidly developing changes in the Financial Services field. © The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology.","","","","","","","","","Can Cryptocurrencies Fulfil the Functions of Money, (2016); Will Blockchain Become the Internet of Finance, (2016); undefined; Iansiti, Marco, The truth about blockchain, Harvard Business Review, 2017, January-February, (2017); How Blockchain Technology Will Disrupt Financial Services Firms, (2016); 10 Things to Know about the Future of Blockchain in Education, (2016); Intelligence Unleashed an Argument for AI in Education, (2016); London Startup Blockchain Raises 40 Million in Fresh Funding, (2017); Promise of Blockchain the Trust Machine, (2015); Harvard Business Review, (2017)","M.H.

We examine the impact of the funding of such start-ups on the stock returns of 47 incumbent US retail banks for 2010 to 2016. Methods: To capture the importance of FinTech start-ups, we use data on both the dollar-volume of funding and number of deals. We relate these to the stock returns with panel data regression methods. Results: Our results indicate a positive relationship exists between the growth in FinTech funding or deals and the contemporaneous stock returns of incumbent retail banks. Conclusions: Although these results suggest complementarity between FinTech and traditional banking, we note that our results at the banking industry level are not statistically significant, and that the coefficient signs for about one-third of the banks are negative, but not statistically significant. Since the FinTech industry is young and our sample period short, we cannot rule out that our findings are spurious. © 2017, The Author(s).","Banks; Digital banking; Finance; FinTech; Innovation; Retail banks; Start-ups; Stock returns; Technology; Venture capital","","","","","","","","Journal of Marketing, (1990); Afuah, Allan N., Responding to structural industry changes: A technological evolution perspective, Industrial and Corporate Change, 6, 1, pp. 183-202, (1997); Benner, Mary J., The incumbent discount: Stock market categories and response to radical technological change, Academy of Management Review, 32, 3, pp. 703-720, (2007); Five Concerns with the Five Factor Model, (2016); Fintech Regulatory Arbitrage and the Rise of Shadow Banks, (2017); Harvard Business Review, (2014); Chishti, Susanne, The FinTech Book: The financial technology handbook for investors, entrepreneurs and visionaries, pp. 1-300, (2016); Innovator S Dilemma When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail, (1997); Dávila, Antonio, Venture capital financing and the growth of startup firms, Journal of Business Venturing, 18, 6, pp. 689-708, (2003); Davis, James L., Characteristics, covariances, and average returns: 1929 to 1997, Journal of Finance, 55, 1, pp. 389-406, (2000)","L.

We assess how security is treated by startups that provide disruptive technologies in the financial sector. In an area that has been committed to security, we find that FinTech companies have modern designs and outstanding user experience as their main priority. This strategy is rewarded by a rapidly increasing customer base but reveals a flawed understanding of security.We analyzed all aspects of security of N26, including the frontend, backend, protocols, human factors, and underlying design concepts, and found issues in all of them. We succeeded in leaking customer data, manipulating and carrying transactions and even could have entirely taken over foreign accounts. We reported these findings to N26 and did not disclose them before they were fixed. By publishing this case study, we hope to raise awareness about security considerations in the critical banking sector, especially for other FinTech startups. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

However, there are well known problems on the fraud detection system. One is too difficult to create an appropriate model for discovering fraud and the other is difficult to detect new types of fraud in the emerging fintech services.

Fintech companies restructure the value chain, re-bundle offerings and create new services that are to be presented and processed digitally - perhaps completely. Nevertheless, recent research with wealthy internet savvy investment customers in Germany shows that this attractive segment can be regarded as hybrid in respect of their demand for digital as well as personal asset management services and products. On the one hand wealthy internet savvy investors indicate a high level of satisfaction with advice and products from their traditional financial services partners. On the other hand they continue to search for better investment opportunities, thus showing significant demand for innovative digital banking/brokerage/advice products. Ultimately, research gives strong evidence for a high need for personal advice and human guidance. This is particularly valid when answering the question which (traditional vs. innovative) partner to choose as the future (exclusive or additional) bank, broker or financial advisor.This paper outlines the world of Fintech start-up companies, presents key findings regarding the attractive and large segment of wealthy internet savvy investors and also explores how the new Fintech conquerors as well as established banks and advisors might embrace this new business environment. © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany 2018.","","","","","","","","","Cutting Through the Noise Around Financial Technology, (2016); undefined, (2016); undefined, (2016); Management in Kreditinstituten Und Unternehmen Ein Querschnitt Aktueller Entwicklungen, (2016); Fintech 100 Leading Global Fintech Innovators Report 2015; undefined; undefined; Unicorn List Current Private Companies Valued at 1B and Above; undefined; undefined","T.

And, it is a commonly used opening phrase for tech start-up investor presentations. Being ""disruptive"" and ""innovative"" are key ingredients for such pitch decks and are inflationary buzzwords in today's venture scene. What's often left out is being visionary and having the goal to create something substantial, something that generates a positive cash flow, building a lasting and leading business. Buzz has replaced reason in so many cases and cause has been replaced with reach, which is the usually the aim of businesses, rather than creating value. When we take a look under the hood of FinTech, we can try to see whether it is actually something - or perhaps just a way of categorizing start-ups of a specific industry. And, as FinTech is very often associated with the omnipresent discussion about crypto currencies and blockchain, we'll take a look at that too. In discussions and in keynotes the word blockchain is also used as a buzzword. Everyone else seems to hop on the same train, leaving it pretty unclear what it actually means or does - what blockchain is. Hype bears the risk of blindness for the risks and limitations there might be. It appears as if everything in IT could be replaced by blockchain these days, yet it is reasonable to believe that might not be the case at all. To start off, we will take a look at how trends have developed in digital business in recent times. © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany 2018.","","","","","","","","","undefined; undefined; undefined; undefined; undefined; undefined; undefined; undefined; undefined; undefined","N.

For decades, existing benefit distribution approaches have been debated by academics, and presented challenges for conservation practitioners. In passing through long chains of project actors, payments incur high transaction costs and are susceptible to elite capture and corruption. A new type of financial technology (FinTech) – ‘mobile money’ – could offer a novel and available solution to these challenges, at what is now a critical stage in PES and REDD+ implementation. Mobile payments (made via cell phones) have been used successfully in development projects related to micro-credit, micro-insurance, and aid relief, and this commentary considers their possible advantages and drawbacks for PES/REDD+ schemes. Several countries e.g. Cambodia, China, Tanzania, and the Philippines demonstrate both high PES/REDD+ uptake, and high mobile money penetration. In certain circumstances benefit distribution via FinTech may lower transaction costs, enable higher frequency payments, and provide new socioeconomic benefits. It could also improve the privacy, transparency, traceability, and security of disbursements, contributing to more efficient and equitable PES and REDD+ schemes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Benefit sharing; Conservation; Economic incentives; Environmental services; Mobile payments; Transaction cost","","","","","","","","Adhikari, Bhim, Designing payments for ecosystem services schemes: Some considerations, Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability, 5, 1, pp. 72-77, (2013); Payment Mechanisms and Anti Poverty Programs Evidence from A Mobile Money Cash Transfer Experiment in Niger, (2014); Banerjee, Simanti, How to sell ecosystem services: A guide for designing new markets, Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, 11, 6, pp. 297-304, (2013); Transforming Our World the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, (2015); Ilo Social Protection and Inclusion Experiences and Policy Issues, (2006); Cacho, Oscar J., Transaction costs of carbon offset projects: A comparative study, Ecological Economics, 88, pp. 232-243, (2013); Calvet-Mir, L., Payments for ecosystem services in the tropics: A closer look at effectiveness and equity, Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability, 14, pp. 150-162, (2015); Carbon Clim Law Rev, (2015); Clements, Tom J., Impact of payments for environmental services and protected areas on local livelihoods and forest conservation in northern Cambodia, Conservation Biology, 29, 1, pp. 78-87, (2015); Global Findex Database 2014 Measuring Financial Inclusion Around the World, (2015)","","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09218009","","ECECE","","English","Ecol.

Authoritative settlement based on central bank support is seen as being essential for both large value and retail payment systems; and, in the EU, UK, and US, the importance of regulating for the protection of consumers who use retail payment systems is recognised. In this institutional context, payment innovations (including Bitcoin and distributed ledger or autonomous organisation technologies) are assessed. It is suggested that, while competition at certain levels is likely to bring social benefits through commercial developments, the maintenance of public interest objectives necessarily delineates the scope of competition. While this might limit the disruptive impact of payment innovations, it is argued that, in the light of the public policy needs for a stable and efficient public infrastructure and the social needs of confidence and trust in a predictable and regulated payment system that meets commercial and social expectations such as in consumer protection, this is not necessarily undesirable. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","clearing and settlement; distributed ledger technology; payment innovation; Payment Services Directive; Payment systems; virtual currency","","","","","","","","","I.H.-Y.

This evolution is characterized by expanded connectivity and enhanced speed of information processing both at the customer interface and in back-office processes. Recently, there has been a shift in the focus of digitalization from improving the delivery of traditional tasks to introducing fundamentally new business opportunities and models for financial service companies. Digital Finance encompasses a magnitude of new financial products, financial businesses, finance-related software, and novel forms of customer communication and interaction—delivered by FinTech companies and innovative financial service providers. Against this backdrop, the research on finance and information systems has started to analyze these changes and the impact of digital progress on the financial sector. Therefore, this article reviews the current state of research in Digital Finance that deals with these novel and innovative business functions. Moreover, it gives an outlook on potential future research directions. As a conceptual basis for reviewing this field, the Digital Finance Cube, which embraces three key dimensions of Digital Finance and FinTech, i.e., the respective business functions, the technologies and technological concepts applied as well as the institutions concerned, is introduced. This conceptualization supports researchers and practitioners when orientating in the field of Digital Finance, allows for the arrangement of academic research relatively to each other, and enables for the revelation of the gaps in research. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Digital Finance; e-Finance; FinTech; Future research opportunities; Literature review; State of the art","","","","","","","Funding text 1: Furthermore, research in the user behavior sub-category has analyzed what projects are selected for funding by the financial backers. For lending-based crowdfunding, lenders prefer projects of borrowers that are culturally similar and geographically proximate (Burtch et al. , ). Furthermore, the authors discover that the negative effect of cultural differences on pledging activities of lenders is decreasing for higher distances. Paravisini et al. () identified that investors show different risk aversion in their decision behavior. Although counter-intuitive, their analysis reveals that wealthier investors have a higher risk aversion and, more intuitive, that investors in crowdfunding behave in a more risk averse manner after negative wealth shocks.; Funding text 2: The authors of these papers have discovered interesting factors that support the successful collecting of money. Zvilichovsky et al. () concentrated on reciprocity in crowdfunding. They found that having helped other founders on the platform by pledging money has a positive effect on successful funding and provided evidence for direct and indirect reciprocity. Mollick () suggested that personal networks and project quality are factors that support funding success. Colombo et al. () supported that backing others (“internal social capital”) is important for funding success. They explained that this effect “is fully mediated by the capital and backers collected in the campaign’s early days”. Koch and Siering () analyzed the influence of project- and founder-specific aspects on funding success and concluded that the use of media (like texts, pictures, and videos) is an important factor supporting success. They also captured the idea of reciprocity and supported its positive influence on funding results. For equity-based crowdfunding, Ahlers et al. () argued that keeping a part of the equity instead of selling the entirety of equity has a positive influence on funding success as this is interpreted as a quality signal and proposed that detailed information about risk and the internal governance (e.g., board structure) also influence funding success.","Agrawal, Ajay K., Crowdfunding: Geography, Social Networks, and the Timing of Investment Decisions, Journal of Economics and Management Strategy, 24, 2, pp. 253-274, (2015); Ahlers, Gerrit K.C., Signaling in Equity Crowdfunding, Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, 39, 4, pp. 955-980, (2015); Allen, Franklin, E-finance: An introduction, Journal of Financial Services Research, 22, 1-2, pp. 5-27, (2002); Allison, Thomas H., Crowdfunding in a prosocial microlending environment: Examining the role of intrinsic versus extrinsic cues, Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, 39, 1, pp. 53-73, (2015); Amit, Raphael, Crafting Business Architecture: the Antecedents of Business Model Design, Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal, 9, 4, pp. 331-350, (2015); Androutsellis-Theotokis, Stephanos, A survey of peer-to-peer content distribution technologies, ACM Computing Surveys, 36, 4, pp. 335-371, (2004); Antweiler, Werner, Is all that talk just noise?

Given the scope, complexity, and dynamism of FinTech solutions, cyberattacks are inevitable, making enhanced security technology indispensable to ensuring future growth. Information leakage is one of the most common vulnerabilities and is still difficult to be prevented completely. The most promising approach to solving this problem is secure computation, which, thanks to its ability to process encrypted data, has proven to be a robust information leakage prevention technology. This paper discusses NEC's own contribution to Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) technology. In SMPC, data on multiple machines can be processed while maintaining the security of the data on each machine. In addition to explaining the technology itself, we will show how it could work in FinTech applications by reviewing some case studies centering around NEC's high-speed method and protection of information for authentication.","Authentication; Information leakage prevention; Secure computation secure multi-party computation; Security","Authentication; Security of data; Cyber security; Encrypted data; Information leakage; Multiple machine; Secure computation; Secure multi-party computation; Security; Security technology; Cryptography","","","","","","","About Macromill; Araki, Toshinori, High-throughput semi-honest secure three-party computation with an honest majority, Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, 24-28-October-2016, pp. 805-817, (2016); Eurocrypt, (2017)","","","NEC Mediaproducts","","","","","","18805884","","","","English","NEC Tech.

Endeavours towards financial inclusion of the underserved SMEs could rationalize why we should allow for or encourage FinTech innovations exemplified by the online supply-chain financing mentioned above. What would be an adaptive regulatory regime for such innovative FinTech-enabled financial services as the online supply-chain financing? Within our conceptual framework to regulate the FinTech industry at the early stage, rather than rigorous rules traditionally placed on large financial institutions, a principles-based strategy should be adopted to strike a balance between financial stability and access to financial services advanced by disruptive innovations. As a necessary complement, regulatory sandboxes would be needed to spur a shift in institutional philosophy to a principles-based regulatory regime. In other words, the regulatory attitude of FinTech regulation should be humble and light-Touch to promote innovation for improving digital financial inclusion, albeit on the premise of containing potential systemic risk and protecting consumer interest in the meantime. © Cambridge University Press and KoGuan Law School, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.","financial disintermediation; financial inclusion; financial technology; light-Touch/humble regulation; principles-based regulation; regulatory sandbox","","","","","","","","Principles of Financial Regulation, (2016); Georgetown Journal of International Law, (2015); Northwestern Journal of International Law Business, (2016); Cesifo, (2016); Oxford Handbook of Financial Regulation, (2015); Brooklyn Journal of Corporate Financial and Commercial Law, (2011); Understanding Regulation Theory Strategy and Practice, (1999); Financial Regulation Law and Policy, (2018); Fintech Building A 21st Century Regulators Toolkit, (2014); Hastings Business Law Journal, (2015)","","","Cambridge University Press Journals_subscriptions@cup.cam.ac.uk","","","","","","20529015","","","","English","Asian J.

Fintech is a new economic industry, comprised of companies that adopted the latest technologies to provide more efficient financial services than the traditional financial services. Fintech companies are generally small to medium sized startups trying to disintermediate existing financial systems. FinTech companies can be differentiated in several areas, based on its business solutions and target customers. In Korea, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending companies are the most prominent in the FinTech sector. P2P lending is a method of borrowing or lending money to individuals through online services without the use of an official financial institution as an intermediary. The P2P lending companies operate their services entirely online or mobile environment. Consequently, mobile P2P lending application users are dramatically increasing. Thus, it is worth evaluating the acceptance of the mobile apps of the P2P lending companies from a user’s perspective. This paper discusses user acceptance of the mobile P2P lending apps, guided by the Technology Acceptance Model. We conclude that the users’ acceptance of mobile P2P lending apps are significantly influenced by perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and user satisfaction. These in turn influenced their attitude towards using mobile P2P lending apps and intention to use. © 2017 KSII.","APIC-IST 2016; FinTech; P2P Lending; P2P Lending Apps; P2P Lending Platform; Social Lending","Peer to peer networks; APIC-IST 2016; Financial institution; FinTech; P2p lending; Perceived ease of use; Perceived usefulness; Social Lending; Technology acceptance model; Finance","","","","","","","Wharton Fintech, (2014); National Digital Research Centre, (2014); Alt, Rainer, The rise of customer-oriented banking - Electronic markets are paving the way for change in the financial industry, Electronic Markets, 22, 4, pp. 203-215, (2012); What is Fintech the Story of Broken Banks, (2015); Boom in Global Fintech Investment, (2014); Accenture, (2016); undefined; Landscaping Uk Fintech; A Trillion Dollar Market by the People for the People how Marketplace Lending Will Remake Banking as We Know It, (2014); Korea Economic Daily, (2015)","S.

At the same time it is challenging regulators. The key issue they face is how to balance the desire to encourage new businesses so as to intensify competition and provide better customer services in the sector, while protecting the system and consumers from excessively risky behaviour and potential disruption. For Indonesia the opportunity is very large given the uneven availability of finance and low levels of financial inclusion.

The FinTech revolution has brought massive changes to the way investing is done. Trading happens in microsecond time frames, and while risks are emerging faster and in greater volume than ever before, traditional risk management approaches are too slow to be relevant. This book describes market microstructure and modern risks, and presents a new way of thinking about risk management in today's high-speed world. Accessible, straightforward explanations shed light on little-understood topics, and expert guidance helps investors protect themselves from new threats. The discussion dissects FinTech innovation to highlight the ongoing disruption, and to establish a toolkit of approaches for analyzing flash crashes, aggressive high frequency trading, and other specific aspects of the market. Today's investors face an environment in which computers and infrastructure merge, regulations allow dozens of exchanges to coexist, and globalized business facilitates round-the-clock deals. This book shows you how to navigate today's investing environment safely and profitably, with the latest in risk-management thinking. Discover risk management that works within micro-second trading. Understand the nature and impact of real-time risk, and how to protect yourself. Learn why flash crashes happen, and how to mitigate damage in advance. Examine the FinTech disruption to established business models and practices. When technology collided with investing, the boom created stratospheric amounts of data that allows us to plumb untapped depths and discover solutions that were unimaginable 20 years ago. Real-Time Risk describes these solutions, and provides practical guidance for today's savvy investor. © 2017 by Irene Aldridge and Steve Krawciw.

We draw from the concepts of sensing and responding to analyse more than 3000 news articles, webpages, reports, and press releases covering the period 2008-2017 related to four Australian Banks. Within the limitations of the method, our findings indicate that Australian Banks are actively embracing FinTech by creating mechanisms for inbound FinTech knowledge flows, monitoring and facilitating FinTech activities of start-ups, crowd-sourcing FinTech ideas, seeting up innovation hubs to encourage internal FinTech innovations, modernizing their platforms with the adoption of technologies commonly associated with startups, partnering, and investing in FinTech start-ups.

Despite societal and regulatory challenges banks have recognised the importance of digital developments and are working intensively on potential solutions and strategies. Many (digital) innovations can primarily be experienced at the client front-end. There is, however, much more to this topic. Isolated solutions are often only implemented in a fragmented fashion from division to division. Innovation processes are still being driven forward laboriously using an outdated silo approach. Furthermore, many banks’ command of the global “language of the internet” is still deficient. The banks will not achieve resounding success using such methods. Digital change requires far-reaching structural reforms that extend beyond all internal and external bank processes and systems. The new market players from the non-bank sector, by contrast, have an almost perfect understanding of the language of the internet. First and foremost it is the scarcely regulated digital ecosystems, but there are also many fintechs that are using their platforms and ingenious “walled garden” strategies to dominate markets across a range of sectors. Their recipe for success is based on the harmonious interplay between implemented hardware and software. Via the optimum interlinking and utilisation of compatible and interoperable standards/technologies we—the platform-spoiled consumers—are courted with attractive products and services conveniently, globally and from a single source. Traditional banks could do this, too, however.

The core technologies on convergence are mobile, smart and cloud. Because of popularization and progress on mobile device and service, the various patterns related with our consumption have been changed. There are many backgrounds in emergence of FinTech industry. In this study, we studied FinTech start-up firms. FinTech refers to a newly emerging industry and service fields through the fusion of finance and ICT. In this study, we studied on current status of FinTech firms. We deal with domestic firms such as Daum Kakao, LGU+. And we described In foreign firms such as Fidor Bank, Simple Online Bank, OnDeck, Stripe and Affirm. Eventually we analyzed problems of the current FinTech firms. In this study, we described several FinTech start-up firms. Many FinTech companies are especially in the payment sector. Two rapidly growing start-ups to notice for the recent five years are studied. A biggest hurdle in electrolyzation of financial service is personal information leakage therefore, biometrics to supplement it gains attention. According to gartner, bio authentication use ratio using mobile devices is forecast to grow from current 5-30%. However, damage may continue to one's life time if bio information leaks. The argument on user's psychological anxiety and human right violation needs to be solved. e-Payment services through non-financial companies like IT companies are on the rapid rise. Competition between financial companies and non-financial companies, between IT companies to preempt the e-payment market is fierce. As the FinTech market rapidly grows associated fields are expected to grow as well. Big data and crowd markets are forecast to grow together security and bio technology markets are also projected to gain attention, since security issue works as a huge hindrance factor for the future of the FinTech markets. © Medwell Journals, 2017.","Banking; FinTech; Payment crowdfunding; Start-up; Technology","","","","","","","","Evolution of Fintech A New Post Crisis Paradigm, (2015); Chishti, Susanne, Preface, pp. viii-ix, (2016); Fintech Challenges and Opportunities how Digitization is Transforming the Financial Sector, (2016); Die Fidor Smart Community Gemeinsam Mehr Geld, (2017); Journal of Financial Perspectives, (2015); Jun, Jooyong, Entry of FinTech Firms and Competition in the Retail Payments Market, Asia-Pacific Journal of Financial Studies, 45, 2, pp. 159-184, (2016); Kauffman, Robert J., Special issue: Contemporary research on payments and cards in the global fintech revolution, Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 14, 5, pp. 261-264, (2015); Wake Forest Law Review, (2015); Schueffel, Patrick, Taming the beast: A scientific definition of fintech, Journal of Innovation Management, 4, 4, pp. 32-54, (2016); Korean Social Login for Magento 1 2, (2017)","","","Medwell Journals medwellonline@gmail.com","","","","","","1816949X","","","","English","J.

This is relentlessly projected to affect competition in some parts of the financial system and to impact its structure and dynamics, calling upon policy- and law-makers to take a close look at the financial stability implications. The aim of this paper is to develop a theoretical framework to aid supervisors, policy- and law-makers in managing risks and harnessing opportunities arising from the transition to the ""FinTech era"". Until now, ""FinTech"" has been vaguely associated with concepts like ""disruption"", ""decentralisation"" and ""disintermediation"". Very little efforts have been spent on explaining the relevance of each of them. Departing from the prevailing current, this paper deploys such concepts as filters in risk-profiling FinTech. According to our model, we identify four filters (economic function, disruptive potential, disintermediation, and decentralisation) against which to categorise ""FinTech"". The output of the filtering process is intended to facilitate the examination of questions relating to policy and regulatory responses.","","","","","","","","","Global Fintech Survey 2016; Oxford Handbook of Banking, (2014); Journal of Technology Law Policy, (2016); Walker, George Alexander, Financial technology law - A new beginning and a new future, International Lawyer, 50, 1, pp. 137-215, (2017); Fair and Effective Markets Review, (2015); Review of Banking and Financial Law, (2012); Harvard Business Law Review, (2012); Brummer, Chris J., Disruptive technology and securities regulation, Fordham Law Review, 84, 3, pp. 977-1052, (2015); Regulating the Shadow Banking System, (2010); Distributed Ledger Technology Beyond Block Chain, (2016)","","","Fondazione Gerardo Capriglione Onlus fondazionecapriglione@luiss.it","","","","","","","","","","English","Law Econ.

However, it is yet to be observed in Latvia to the same extent. This paper aims to evaluate fintech's level of development in Latvia compared to Europe. The paper identifies financial services using innovative technologies offered by fintech companies, analyses the advantages and disadvantages of these services in comparison with services offered by the traditional financial sector companies (banks, insurance companies, institutions involved in asset management and investment, etc.), and evaluates how prepared are consumers to use fintech services. This paper documents the results of the survey aiming to clarify how well-informed consumers in Latvia are about fintech services, their convenience, speed and safety, as well as the consumers' current satisfaction with banking services. The hypothesis of this paper is that Latvian society is not ready to use services provided by fintech, but prefers banking services instead. Survey results provide some evidence in favour of this hypothesis: they show that respondents are generally unaware about fintech services in Latvia and their associated innovations and new financial products. This paper makes several recommendations for managers of fintech enterprises, association of start-up enterprises and risk capital funds as well as state institutions.","Competition; Fintech; Innovation in financial services","","","","","","","","Future of Fintech and Banking Digitally Disrupted or Reimagined, (2015); Anikina, Irina D., Methodological aspects of prioritization of financial tools for stimulation of innovative activities, European Research Studies Journal, 19, 2 Special Issue, pp. 100-112, (2016); Consumers and Mobile Financial Services 2016, (2016); Consumers and Mobile Financial Services 2015, (2015); Counting the World S Unbanked, (2010); Opportuities for Mobile Financial Services to Engage Qualitative Research Findings, (2016); Fetai, Besnik Taip, Financial integration and financial development: Does financial integration matter?, European Research Studies Journal, 18, 2, pp. 97-106, (2015); Harrison, Rupert, Does innovation stimulate employment?

At current stage exchanges are mainly exploring the technology looking for proofs of concept, with the exception of some more advanced projects like at Nasdaq and ASX. The mass adoption will require longer efforts and is expected to come in a decade, at least. Fintech developments are receiving strong attention also by regulators and international organizations, given the potential of distributed ledger technology for both competition enhancement and cyber risk reduction.

Design/methodology/approach: With a literature review on the global regulatory environment and the underlying risks related to Fintech, it looks into the formulation and implementation of complementary regulatory policies in the case of Hong Kong as a GFC. Relevant policy documents disclosed by the financial regulator on cybersecurity and pertinent issues are examined. Findings: Adopting a strategic approach that seizes opportunities associated with Fintech, the financial regulator harnesses comprehensive risk-based mechanisms to embrace exposures to cyber risks while promoting institutionalization of cybersecurity among the regulated firms with strategic controls. This study suggests a pathway for the evolution of a profession with both technical and ethical competence for mitigating the emerging risks arising from Fintech. However, such an approach is yet to be tested with respect to efficacy for the unexplored territories of fraud exposures, resulting from swift Fintech developments across borders. Research limitations/implications: As Fintech has only emerged rapidly in the recent years, it is not conclusive in this review of performance and effectiveness of the financial regulator in its strategic approach. Further studies may utilize a longitudinal method to analyze and examine the regulatory measures undertaken by financial regulators in various GFCs. Originality/value: This study reveals a strategic approach adopted by an emerged GFC in embracing Fintech innovation that however brings about unidentified risks and potential frauds to its financial services sector. Pertinent anti-fraud and cybersecurity measures are highlighted. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cybersecurity; Fintech; Fraud; Global financial centre; Hong Kong; Risk-based approach","","","","","","","","Future of Fintech and Banking Digitally Disrupted or Reimagined, (2015); Fintech and the Evolving Landscape Landing Points for the Industry, (2016); Fraud Detection Using Data Analytics in the Banking Industry, (2014); Alexander, Kern, Global Governance of Financial Systems : The International Regulation of Systemic Risk, pp. 1-327, (2007); Fintech, (2016); Evolution of Fintech A New Post Crisis Paradigm, (2015); What is Fraud, (2016); Complying with Aml Laws Challenges for the Fintech Industry, (2016); First Ever Fintech Bridge Established Between Britain and Singapore, (2016); Insider Fraud, (2015)","A.W.

At the juncture of these phenomena lies regulatory technology or “RegTech”—the use of technology, particularly information technology, in the context of regulatory monitoring, reporting, and compliance. Regulating rapidly transforming financial systems requires increasing the use of and reliance on RegTech. Whilst the principal regulatory objectives (e.g., financial stability, prudential safety and soundness, consumer protection and market integrity, and market competition and development) remain, their means of application are increasingly inadequate. RegTech developments are leading towards a paradigm shift necessitating the reconceptualization of financial regulation. RegTech to date has focused on the digitization of manual reporting and compliance processes. This offers tremendous cost savings to the financial services industry and regulators. However, the potential of RegTech is far greater – it has the potential to enable a nearly real-time and proportionate regulatory regime that identifies and addresses risk while facilitating more efficient regulatory compliance. We argue that the transformative nature of technology will only be captured by a new approach at the nexus of data, digital identity, and regulation. This paper seeks to expose the inadequacy of digitizing analogue processes in a digital financial world, sets the foundation for a practical understanding of RegTech, and proposes sequenced reforms that could benefit regulators, industry, and entrepreneurs in the financial sector and other industries. © 2017.

This study aims to identify the strategic considerations in the process of searching for FinTech investment targets. Case description: This study used a case study investigation of a top-5 bank in Taiwan. The major data sources include the meeting notes of the FinTech investment task force and interviews with the team members. Co-opetition theory was adopted as the theoretical framework and interview questions were derived from the PARTS strategies in co-petition theory. The results relate to: (1) the strategic goals of FinTech investment, (2) the added value from FinTech companies, (3) criteria in selecting candidates in the same FinTech area, (4) choosing to work as either a cooperator or a competitor, and (5) barriers from policies and regulations. Discussion and evaluation: This study has several findings: (1) regulations and policies shape FinTech’s development; (2) banks, technology companies, and customers are not “FinTech ready;” (3) Compare top-down with bottom up strategies; (4) banks and FinTech companies have complex relationships; (5) it is unlikely that Taiwan will produce FinTech disruptors in the near future. Conclusion: The findings and discussion can benefit researchers and administrators in finance-related industries. More studies are desired to observe long-term development in terms of how companies collaborate or compete in specific FinTech areas. © 2016, The Author(s).","Bank 3.0; Co-opetition Theory; FinTech; Investment in FinTech; PARTS; Taiwan bank industry; Taiwan FinTech Industry","","","","","","Total","• Financial Research and Data (79 startups, 824 M total funding)","Global Fintech Investment Growth Continues in 2016 Driven by Europe and Asia, (2016); Benbasat, Izak, The case research strategy in studies of information systems, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 11, 3, pp. 369-386, (1987); Co Opetition, (1996); Cavaye, Angèle L.M., Case study research: A multi-faceted research approach for IS, Information Systems Journal, 6, 3, pp. 227-242, (1996); Econ Res, (2011); Financial Supervisory Committee Big Data Project, (2015); Construct Digital Finance Environments, (2015); Act Governing Electronic Payment Institutions, (2015); Regulations of Bank and Financial Holding Company Investing Fintech Firms, (2015); Regulations of Industry of Information Service and Industry of Finance Technology Determined by the Competent Authority as Finance Related Industry, (2015)","J.-L.

Therefore, FinTech has become a subject of debate among practitioners, investors, and researchers and is highly visible in the popular media. In this study, we unveil the drivers motivating the FinTech phenomenon perceived by the English and German popular press including the subjects discussed in the context of FinTech. This study is the first one to reflect the media perspective on the FinTech phenomenon in the research. In doing so, we extend the growing knowledge on FinTech and contribute to a common understanding in the financial and digital innovation literature. These study contributes to research in the areas of information systems, finance and interdisciplinary social sciences. Moreover, it brings value to practitioners (entrepreneurs, investors, regulators, etc.), who explore the field of FinTech. © 2016, The Author(s).","Content analysis; Digitalization; FinTech; Innovation; Popular press","","","","","","","","Bbva Research, (2015); Cukier, Wendy L., Applying Habermas' validity claims as a standard for critical discourse analysis, IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology, 143, pp. 233-257, (2004); Cukier, Wendy L., A critical analysis of media discourse on information technology: Preliminary results of a proposed method for critical discourse analysis, Information Systems Journal, 19, 2, pp. 175-196, (2009); Deutsche Bank Research, (2014); undefined, (2016); Fichman, Robert G., Digital innovation as a fundamental and powerful concept in the information systems curriculum, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 38, 2, pp. 329-353, (2014); Finkel, Jenny Rose, Incorporating non-local information into information extraction systems by Gibbs sampling, pp. 363-370, (2005); Frame, W.

The authors assume the general methodological approach of grounded theory to study four cases of financial technology platforms from Russia; the sample represents companies focusing both on solutions for the front end (consumers) and back end (middle of the value chain). The research finds that the top executives of the companies, which create and operate the digital platforms, have an approach to business strategy that is significantly different from that of the traditional business. They defy the pragmatism of predicting the market development and planning the company's actions in accordance with such predictions. Strategic paradigm of these companies is based on the notions of inclusivity, dynamism, and reliance on independent participants of a business ecosystem. Though a radical departure from the traditional business strategy, such an approach has brought demonstrable business success across the time span of a decade. The idea of “platform–ecosystem” can also be fruitful as a tool of solving important socioeconomic issues such as financial inclusion in the emerging markets. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","","","","","","","","","International Proceedings of Economics Development and Research, (2012); Harvard Business Review, (2013); Cgd Policy Paper, (2015); Statistics of National Payment System, (2015); Grounded Theory Methodology an Overview, (1994); Handbook of Qualitative Research, (1994); Academy of Management Review, (1989); Eisenhardt, Kathleen M., Theory building from cases: Opportunities and challenges, Academy of Management Journal, 50, 1, pp. 25-32, (2007); Grounded Theory Core Elements Part 1, (2010); Strategies for Qualitative Research, (1967)","O.

In this article, we report the cash-based monetary practices of one Ethiopian rural community and identify their implications for the design of new financial technology. Particularly, we focus on addressing the question, What characteristic features should go into the design of mobile money application(s) to embody a rural Ethiopian community’s money practices in social (marriage and death) and religious contexts? Primary data on everyday practices of the community were collected. Analysis of our data reveals that new financial technology design should support lived experiences such as embedded social meaning, segregated and aggregate money control, restricted money use, identity extension and hiding, refusal and acceptance of donations, disclosed and secret money practices, and assigning aesthetics to money. The article concludes by discussing possible ways of mapping these concepts into financial system design, thus contributing toward the development of cashless transactions and a cashless society. © © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","Human computer interaction; User interfaces; Ethiopia; Financial system; Primary data; Rural community; Technology designs; Ubiquitous technology; Finance","","","","","","","Aaker, Jennifer Lynn, Why do people give?

Known as FinTech, these services influence competitive advantage for their ability to create innovation beyond the framework of conventional financial services. Acting as an enabler for creating innovation, Hitachi is taking a close look at AI, and working on its utilization in the financial sector. This article looks at phenomena such as FinTech and the IoT as precursors of changes in the financial industry. It discusses how AI is being used in the financial industry through activities designed to raise management KPIs by quantitatively evaluating organizational activity levels from action data acquired from wearable terminals. The article also describes the future outlook for AI use by examining concepts such as the development of business applications that use embedded AI.","","","","","","","","","Fintech Revolution, (2015); Transactions of the Institute of Electronics Information and Communication Engineers, (2013); Yano, Kazuo, Measuring happiness using wearable technology:Technology for boosting productivity in knowledge work and service businesses, Hitachi Review, 64, 8, pp. 517-524, (2015); Invisible Hand of Data the Rule for People Organizations and Society Uncovered by Wearable Sensors, (2014)","","","Hitachi Ltd.","","","","","","0018277X","","HITAA","","English","Hitachi Rev.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84978370420"

With a model of two-sided market with vertical restraints, we derive the following results. When only the entry of a vertically integrated (or end-to-end service) provider is allowed, either all merchants opt for multi-homing or no entry occurs, regardless of the regulatory requirement. On the other hand, if the entry of a downstream-only (or front-end service) provider is allowed, a partial multi-homing equilibrium could emerge under certain conditions, in which the entry of an end-to-end service provider does not occur. Without regulation, however, the vertically integrated incumbent does not voluntarily provide the back-end service to the entrant in general. This suggests the need for proper regulatory measures to reach a socially desirable outcome from the new entry in the retail payments market. © 2016 Korean Securities Association.","End-to-end; Entry; FinTech; Front-end; Retail payment","","","","","","","","Boom in Global Fintech Investment A New Growth Opportunity for London Technical Report, (2014); Anderson, Ross J., The economics of information security, Science, 314, 5799, pp. 610-613, (2006); Armstrong, Mark, Competition in two-sided markets, RAND Journal of Economics, 37, 3, pp. 668-691, (2006); Journal of Law and Economics, (1983); Managing Information Risk and the Economics of Security, (2009); Banks New Competitors Starbucks Google and Alibaba Harvard Business Review Online, (2014); World Payments Report 2013 Technical Report, (2013); World Payments Report 2015 Technical Report, (2015); Choi, Jay Pil, Tying in two-sided markets with multi-homing, Journal of Industrial Economics, 58, 3, pp. 607-626, (2010); Non Banks in Retail Payments, (2014)","E.

In addition, it analyzed the causal relationship between concern for information privacy and self-efficacy by adopting them as moderating variables. Results suggested that usefulness, ease of use and credibility had an effect on intention to use, and self-efficacy was found to have an moderating effect on independent and dependent variables. Further, concern for information privacy was found to be a factor obstructing the path to intention to use. The implications of this study are that in the promotion of payment-type Fintech services, convenience and usefulness are the most critical and influential variables in terms of usage, while government deregulation and stronger security are called for from an institutional aspect. © Research India Publications.","Elaboration likelihood model; Fintech; K pay; Mobile payment service","","","","","","","","Communication and Persuasion Central and Peripheral Routes to Attitude Change, (1986); Davis, Fred D., Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and user acceptance of information technology, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 13, 3, pp. 319-339, (1989); Financial Terminology Dictionary, (2015); Schierz, Paul Gerhardt, Understanding consumer acceptance of mobile payment services: An empirical analysis, Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 9, 3, pp. 209-216, (2010); Journal of Korean Association of Computer Education, (2015); Bhattacherjee, Anol, Influence processes for information technology acceptance: An elaboration likelihood model, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 30, 4, pp. 805-825, (2006); Korean Journal of Information Technology Services, (2015); Journal of Society for E Business Studies, (2011); Information Technology and Management, (2000); Information Systems Review, (2007)","","","Research India Publications subscription@ripublication.com","","","","","","09734562","","","","English","Int.

Author John Waupsh is the Chief Innovation Officer at Kasasa, where he helps spearhead financial product development and implementation across hundreds of institutions. In this guide, he draws on more than a decade in the industry to offer clear, practical advice for competing with the megabanks, direct banks, non-banks, and financial technology companies. The discussion separates futurist thinking from today's realities, and dispels common myths surrounding the U.S. community banking model in order to shed light on the real challenges facing community banking institutions. It follows with clear solutions, proven strategies, and insight from experts across banking and fintech. All arguments are backed by massive amounts of data, and the companion website provides presentation-ready visualizations to help you kickstart change within your team. In the U.S. and around the globe, fintech companies and non-banks alike are creating streams of banking services that are interesting, elegant, and refreshing—and they're winning the hearts and minds of early adopters. Not a one-size-fits-all approach, this book offers many different tactics for community banks and credit unions to compete and flourish in the new world. • Analyze fintech's threat to the community banking model • Learn where community banking must improve to compete • Disprove the myths to uncover the real challenges banks face • Adopt proven strategies to bring your organization into the future Community banks and credit unions were once the go-to institutions for local relationship banking, but their asset share has been on the decline for three decades as the big banks just got bigger. Now, fintech companies are exploiting inefficiencies in the traditional banking model to streamline service and draw even more market share, as community banking executives are left at a loss for fresh tactics and forward-looking strategy.

This paper explores the complexity of Fintech, and attempts a definition, drawn from a process of reviewing more than 200 scholarly articles referencing the term Fintech and covering a period of more than 40 years. The objective of this study is to offer a definition which is distinct as well as succinct in its communication, yet sufficiently broad in its range of application. As the origins of the term can neither be unequivocally placed in academia nor in practice, the definition concentrates on extracting out the quintessence of Fintech using both spheres. Applying semantic analysis and building on the commonalities of 13 peerreviewed definitions of the term, it is concluded that Fintech is a new financial industry that applies technology to improve financial activities. The implications as well as the shortcomings of this definition are discussed. © 2021 Journal of Innovation Management.

Therefore, this study will focus on reviewing the information security framework by adopting up-to-date standards as the way to counter financial information theft.","Cyberattack; Fintech; Hacker; Information Security System","Crime; Electronic commerce; Finance; Network security; Personal computing; Security of data; Cyber-attacks; Financial information; Financial institution; Fintech; Hacker; Remote location; Computer crime","","","","","","","Generic Tasks in Knowledge Based Reasoning High Level Building Blocks for Expert System Design IEEE Expert, (1986); Raychaudhuri, Dipankar, WirelessATM networks: Architecture, system design and prototyping, IEEE Personal Communications, 3, 4, pp. 42-49, (1996); North Carolina Banking Institute, (2016); Bitcoin A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System, (2008)","","Peng, L.","CEUR-WS","","16th International Conference on Electronic Business, ICEB 2016","2016-12-04 through 2016-12-08","Xiamen","128172","16830040","","","","English","Proc.

FIDO services are adapting a variety of service areas such as easy payment, money transfer, ATM withdrawal/savings, and single sign-on, etc. Because FIDO service uses standard public key cryptography techniques to provide stronger authentication and securely saves a user's bio-information in the smartphone. But when registered, FIDO only confirms the match between pre-enrolled fingerprints and the one on the registration process. In other words, FIDO is not able to verify the person's identity. The user has to register his/her biometric information in each sites. It is our purpose to solve these problems by implementing FIDO and PKI technologies adapted in current FIDO service and accredited certification system.

Yet this diversification has the banking landscape has not resolves credit allocation inefficiency. Indeed, whilst SME represent 80 % of the economic output of the country, it is only receiving 20 % of the credit originated by banks. This has spurred the development of shadow banking, an informal and unregulated network of lenders and borrowers. The emergence of Financial Technology has allowed for this activity digitized itself in the form of Peer-to-peer lending channel. The combination of and unregulated market and large credit gap has lead to the emergence of a sector that had only one platform in 2007 and over 2000 in 2015.

Financial technologies (FinTech) have become an integral part of banking, and nowadays banks have started to compete beyond financial services facing increasing competition from nonfinancial institutions providing, for example, payment services. Start-up service providers, search engines, and social networks have expanded their services ""interfering"" in the fields traditionally covered by banks. The rapid rise of FinTech has changed the business landscape in banking asking for more innovative solutions. These recent tendencies require the banks to increase investment in FinTech, rethink service distribution channels, especially the business-to-consumers models, increase further standardization of backoffice functions, etc. Some members of the financial services industry see the boom in FinTech as a threat to traditional banking industry. Others believe that FinTech has become a challenge that can be turned into an opportunity as it provides more flexibility, better functionality in some areas, and aggregation of services. The aim of the paper is to analyze the recent trends in banking, identifying opportunities and risks of FinTech for banks. A timely integration of FinTech into business allows banks to get an advantage in growing competition. This paper provides an extensive analysis of recent trends in FinTech and banking, examining experience of leading European and US banks, as well as surveys conducted among members of the financial services industry in different countries. The authors have studied the development of the financial innovation and technology market, assessed the existing practices applied in the field of FinTech, identified the main risks related to development of FinTech and financial innovations the banks are exposed to on the micro- and macrolevel. The paper provides recommendations for regulators and banks to ensure reduction of risks associated with development of FinTech. Analysis of FinTech market has shown growing competition, including from nonfinancial institutions. The paper provides practical recommendations to commercial banks for strengthening the position in financial innovations and controlling the risks associated with introduction of financial innovations. © © 2017 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited all Rights of Reproduction in Any form Reserved.","Banking innovations; FinTech; Risks","","","","","","","","undefined; undefined; Alt, Rainer, The rise of customer-oriented banking - Electronic markets are paving the way for change in the financial industry, Electronic Markets, 22, 4, pp. 203-215, (2012); Evolution of Fintech A New Post Crisis Paradigm, (2015); American Banker; Deutsche Bank Research, (2014); undefined; undefined, (2015); undefined; Kpmg","","","Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.

Crowdlending and Digital Advice offer additional opportunities for customers to manage their assets. In the banking market, “FinTechs” are the most notable example of what Schumpeter described as “creative destruction”. They could threaten the existence of established banks. Therefore the banks should use the FinTechs as a testing laboratory for customer behavior and testing ground for a more modern marketing policy. This environment gives rise to concerns that there may develop an unregulated area of shadow banks. But it should be considered that a level playing fi eld has to be ensured and that innovative processes and products are not stalled. A potential advantage of Digital Advice is that consumers can have the possibility to access the relevant information they need to make their fi nancial decisions. Consumers, in turn, are only able to benefi t from this advantage if competition between fi nancial service providers leads to a supply of clear and comprehensible information about fi nancial products and an appropriate degree of data security. The rise of Big Data analyses in retail banking allows a more precise estimation of creditworthiness risk as well as a consumer’s willingness-to-pay, propensity to switch and responsiveness to marketing offers. This not only impacts on competition, it represents major challenges for policymakers, authorities and consumers alike. © 2016 Springer Verlag.

In parallel with the regulatory changes, the banks are subject to pressure from accelerated technology development and social changes. These two factors influence the behavior of customers and induce changes in the customer relationship management (CRM). Taking the example of retail banking, the factors and their impacts are explained. Additionally, a view on the FinTech industry is presented, highlighting areas where traditional financial institutions are losing market share to technology-savvy and socially oriented new ventures with exceptional CRM capabilities. The conclusion contains proposed strategic actions that need to be undertaken in order to prepare the financial services industry for managing customer relationships in the increasingly technosocial environment. © 2016.

Author Paul Schulte, former economic analyst with the National Security Council, draws upon his own decade-spanning research to demonstrate how unethical banking practices provide the brute force that drives political and economic crises worldwide. By unbundling how credit markets work, this authoritative guide provides deep insight into crisis avoidance and detection, successful investment climates, and the groundwork that must be in place for policy makers to build a sound basis for economic growth. Clear, succinct case studies provide examples of policy and its effects on economic stability, giving you a stronger understanding of the network of forces that determine how loan/deposit ratios behave around the world. Countries that lend more than they save consistently get into trouble, with catastrophic consequences for the rich and middle class as well as the politicians. This book shows how credit excesses bring about price collapse in stocks, currencies, and real estate, and provides direction for change in the context of global economics. •Dive deep into the mechanisms underlying the credit markets •Learn how unregulated borrowing leads to socioeconomic crises •Examine real-world policy options through global case studies •Discover how credit rises are best detected and avoided An economic climate in which even the smallest hiccup can have long-lasting consequences should be the ideal impetus for a close scrutiny of global banking practices and economic policy. The Next Revolution in our Credit-Driven Economy takes you behind the scenes for a new perspective, and a more informed look at where the world needs to begin changing. The second half of the book will take a look at the revolution driving financial technology. Companies in Silicon Valley and giants like Alibaba are challenging the landscape for banking. This has profound implications for policy makers, banks and for a new class of entrepreneurs who are developing software which is taking away market share from bank and challenging decades-old financial empires. The book will explore the reasons why many global banks remain flat-footed. It will go into detail about the new companies and software that are moving in the Far East and with innovations in securities, bonds, foreign exchange, retail lending and SME lending. Lastly the book will look at the strategy behind Alibaba and how it will challenge many companies from a powerful base inside China. © 2015 by John Wiley & Sons Singapore Pte. Ltd.

This book focuses on the role of technology in global finance and reflects on the ethical and societal meaning and impact of financial information and communication technologies (ICTs). Exploring the history, metaphysics, and geography of money, algorithms, and electronic currencies, the author argues that financial ICTs contribute to impersonal, disengaged, placeless, and objectifying relations, and that in the context of globalization these ‘distancing’ effects render it increasingly difficult to exercise and ascribe responsibility. Caught in the currents of capital, it seems that both experts and lay people have lost control and lack sufficient knowledge of what they are doing. There is too much epistemic, social, and moral distance. At the same time, the book also shows that these electronically mediated developments do not render global finance merely ‘virtual’, for its technological practices remain material and place–bound, and the ethical and social vulnerabilities they create are no less real. Moreover, understood in terms of technological practices, global finance remains human through and through, and there is no technological determinism. Therefore, Money Machines also examines the ways in which contemporary techno-financial developments can be resisted or re–oriented in a morally and socially responsible direction – not without, but with technology. As such, it will appeal to philosophers and scholars across the humanities and the social sciences with interests in science and technology, finance, ethics and questions of responsibility. © Mark Coeckelbergh 2015.

In this enhancement program, the FSA recommended that regional financial institutions introduce new financial products such as collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) and collateralized bond obligations (CBOs). However, this was left up to each institution's discretion rather than being mandatory. This resulted in a large difference in the introduction of new products. Therefore, this article has analysed what kinds of credit associations favourably increased the use of new financial products. As a result, it has been confirmed that the larger their lending shares and management scale and the better their business conditions are, the more positively they work on the introduction of new products. Considering the fact that relationships between financial institutions and enterprises tend to be fixed in Japan, this means that medium and small enterprises will have restrictions on the financial products they can use depending on the situation of their main banks. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","","credit provision; financial services; institutional framework; lending behavior; small and medium-sized enterprise; Japan","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS","This research is financially supported by the Grant-in-Aid from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (Kakenhi).","Boot, Arnoud W.

The value of the asset lies in its transactional relations with other assets in the ecosystem or in other words being part of the architecture of related assets. It is argued that the deployment of financial trading software, as a product in brokerage houses in the emerging securities trading ecosystem in India by the software firm called Financial Technologies (FT), hastened institutionalization of new rules governing transactions embedded in the software design. As a result, FT implicitly collaborated with the regulator and other ecosystem participants who coordinated the innovation in design of the ecosystem. The software firm went on to expand the market for its own products (trading software) by incubating exchange ventures. This was achieved through a strategy of spawning of linked subsidiaries that led to both a growth of the trading ecosystem and further entrenchment of the innovated ecosystem. © 2010, IGI Global.","","","","","","","","","On Poetic Imagination and Reverie, (1971); Biomedical Innovation in India with A Comparison to China and Others, (2008); Nasdaq A History of the Market that Changed the World, (2002); Interim Report of the Janakiraman Committee to Probe into the Securities Scam, (1992); Report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee to Probe into the Securities Scam of 1992, (1992); Lucas, Henry C., The defensive use of IT in a newly vulnerable market: The New York Stock Exchange, 1980-2007, Journal of Strategic Information Systems, 18, 1, pp. 3-15, (2009); Institutions Institutional Change and Economic Performance, (1990); Epw, (2006); Approach Paper on Implementation of STP in Indian Markets, (2002); Revised Scheme for Implementing Straight Through Processing in India, (2004)","","","IGI Global","","","","","","","9781615206094","","","English","Cases on Technol.

The paper presents Technology Entrepreneurship in the curricula at a leading school of computer science and information systems, in which students are beginning to learn the theory and practice of skills needed to be business entrepreneurs or opportunists, and not mere scientists. The concentration in entrepreneurship is designed in the current model program in the disciplinary domain of the financial industry.
