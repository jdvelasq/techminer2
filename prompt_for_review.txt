Review and grade the code’s adherence to professional coding style.

Perform the evaluation under the following constraints:
- The package is strictly for private, personal use (no public API, no onboarding concerns).
- The package represents a competitive productivity advantage, so clarity, consistency, and efficiency are critical.
- The code relies on self-documenting structure (clear naming, logical decomposition); comments and docstrings are intentionally avoided.
- Trust at 2 a.m. is essential. 
- The code will be production-ready for my research.
- The code will be exactly how professional Python code should be written
- Doctests are the primary technique of testing
- Doctests must be strong.
- All recommendations must be aligned with the practices in Python's major libraries (pandas, requests, matplotlib, scikit-learn, numpy, scipy, statsmodels, etc.)
- All imported or external functions are assumed to be already reviewed and should not be re-evaluated unless their usage degrades code quality.

Focus the review on:
- Naming precision and semantic clarity
- Structural consistency and logical flow
- Readability without explanatory comments
- Professional-grade design decisions that improve long-term maintainability

Provide:
- A numeric score (0–100) for professional style
- A brief justification for the score
- Concrete, minimal suggestions that would measurably improve the score, without adding comments or docstrings
