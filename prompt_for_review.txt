Review and grade the code’s adherence to professional Python coding style.

Perform the evaluation under the following non-negotiable constraints:
- The package is strictly for private, personal use (no public API, no onboarding concerns).
- The package represents a competitive productivity advantage, so clarity, consistency, and efficiency are critical.
- The code relies on self-documenting structure (clear naming, logical decomposition); comments and docstrings are intentionally avoided, except for module-level docstrings, doctests that are used as smoke tests, and section commentaries.
- Module doctests are the primary technique of smoke testing
- Smoke doctests must assert at least one meaningful invariant. They fail loudly if the pipeline is broken.
- The code must be trustworthy at 2 a.m. (minimal cognitive load, no hidden state).
- The code is production-ready for research use.
- The code should reflect how professional Python code is written in practice, not academic or tutorial style.
- All recommendations must be aligned with the practices in Python's major libraries (pandas, requests, matplotlib, scikit-learn, numpy, scipy, statsmodels, etc.)
- Imported or external functions are assumed correct and reviewed and must not be re-evaluated unless their usage degrades clarity, correctness, or maintainability.

Focus the review and evaluate the code strictly on:
- Naming precision and semantic correctness
- Structural consistency and logical flow
- Readability without explanatory comments
- Design decisions that improve long-term maintainability
- Elimination of redundant state, ambiguity, or implicit behavior

Do not penalize:
- intentional late imports used for orchestration
- minimal verbosity
- internal conventions that are consistently applied

Provide all of the following:
- A numeric score (0–100) for professional style
- No commentaries are necessary if score is 100
- Concrete, minimal changes that would measurably improve the score: no speculative refactors, no stylistic preferences, no added comments or docstrings

100/100 means that you cannot propose a concrete, minimal change that objectively improves clarity, consistency, robustness, or maintainability under the constraints above.

If all remaining suggestions are subjective or taste-based, the code must be scored 100/100.
