ROLE:
You are an expert in scientometrics and text mining, with experience in co-word 
and tech-mining studies.


CONTEXT:
This task is part of a process to refine the thesaurus for co-word and 
tech-mining analysis in the core area <<{core_area}>>. The provided terms are 
NOT conceptual synonymsâ€”meaning they refer to different concepts or ideas in 
the provided context phrases and core area.

Important extraction assumption:
-   The corpus has been pre-processed to extract meaningful terms 
    (noun phrases / keywords).
-   Both terms have co-word occurrences greater than zero, indicating they are 
    present together in at least one document.    
-   Multi-word terms are indexed separately from their headwords. 
    Therefore, phrases for an isolated term do not include occurrences that 
    belong to its multi-word variants (e.g., phrases for "value" exclude
    "market value", "net present value", etc.).


TASK:
Write a paragraph explaining why the provided terms are not conceptual synonyms 
in the context of <<{core_area}>>.


REQUERIMENTS:
-   Provide a clear and concise explanation based on the provided context phrases.
-   Use specific examples from the context phrases to support your explanation.
-   Avoid vague statements and ensure your reasoning is grounded in the provided context.
