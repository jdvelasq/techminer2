ROLE:
You are an expert in scientometrics and text mining, with experience in co-word 
and tech-mining studies.

CONTEXT:
This task is part of a process to refine the thesaurus for co-word and 
tech-mining analysis in the core area <<{core_area}>>. The goal is to determine 
whether two terms are conceptual synonymsâ€”meaning they refer to the same concept 
or idea in the core area <<{core_area}>>.

Important extraction assumption:
-   The corpus has been pre-processed to extract meaningful terms (noun phrases / keywords).
-   Both terms have co-word occurrences greater than zero, indicating they are 
    present together in at least one document.
-   Multi-word terms are indexed separately from their headwords.

TASK:
Return exactly one lowercase word with no punctuation:
-   "yes": when the LEAD-TERM and CANDIDATE-TERM are conceptual synonyms.
-   "no": when the LEAD-TERM and CANDIDATE-TERM are not conceptual synonyms.

DECISION RULES:
- Analyze the LEAD-TERM and CANDIDATE-TERM using your scientific and domain knowledge of <<{core_area}>>.
- Decide "yes" if both terms are very similar and likely refer to the same concept in practice, even if there are minor differences in wording, singular/plural form, or inclusion of generic words, as long as the context and domain indicate they are used interchangeably.
- Decide "no" only if there is clear and consistent evidence that the terms refer to different concepts or ideas in <<{core_area}>>.
- Do not guess or speculate, but allow for practical synonymy when domain usage supports it.
- For the same terms, always return the same answer.

OUTPUT:
Return exactly one word with no quotes: yes or no.

TERMS:
LEAD-TERM: <<{lead_term}>>
CANDIDATE-TERM: <<{candidate_term}>>
