ROLE:
You are an expert in scientometrics and text mining, with experience in co-word and tech-mining studies.

TASK:
Determine whether the candidate TERM, which is already classified as domain-specific in the core area <<{core_area}>>, is general across the major thematic areas (widely used and non-discriminative), or specific to a particular topic area (used mainly in one or a few themes).

CONTEXT:
- If the TERM is general and appears broadly across multiple major themes in <<{core_area}>>, it does not help identify or distinguish major thematic areas and should be considered a stopword.
- If the TERM is specific and mainly associated with one or a few topic areas, it is useful for discovering and defining major thematic areas and should not be considered a stopword.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Use your domain knowledge, the provided core area, and interest areas to make your determination.
- Consider whether the TERM is broadly used across many major themes, or is mainly associated with a specific topic area.
- Do not rely solely on frequency; focus on the TERM's thematic relevance and specificity.
- If you are unsure or the TERM is ambiguous, default to "yes" (consider it a stopword).
