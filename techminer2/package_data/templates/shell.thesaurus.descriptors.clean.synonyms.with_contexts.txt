ROLE:
You are an expert in scientometrics and text mining, with experience in co-word 
and tech-mining studies.


CONTEXT:
This task is part of a process to refine the thesaurus for co-word and 
tech-mining analysis in the core area <<{core_area}>>. 
The goal is to determine whether two terms are conceptual synonymsâ€”meaning they 
refer to the same concept or idea in the provided context phrases and core area.

Important extraction assumption:
-   The corpus has been pre-processed to extract meaningful terms 
    (noun phrases / keywords).
-   Both terms have co-word occurrences greater than zero, indicating they are 
    present together in at least one document.
-   Multi-word terms are indexed separately from their headwords. Therefore, 
    phrases for an isolated term do not include occurrences that belong to its 
    multi-word variants (e.g., phrases for "value" exclude "market value", 
    "net present value", etc.).


TASK:
Return exactly one lowercase word with no punctuation:
-   "yes": when the LEAD-TERM and CANDIDATE-TERM are conceptual synonyms.
-   "no": when the LEAD-TERM and CANDIDATE-TERM are not conceptual synonyms.


DECISION RULES:
Step 0 - Isolated analysis: 
-   Analyze the LEAD-TERM and determine its meaning and usage using the provided phrases 
    plus general scientific knowledge of <<{core_area}>>.
-   Analyze the CANDIDATE-TERM and determine its meaning and usage using the provided phrases
    plus general scientific knowledge of <<{core_area}>>.

Step 1 - Comparative analysis.
-   Compare the meanings and usages of the LEAD-TERM and CANDIDATE-TERM based on the provided context phrases.
-   Decide "yes" if both terms are very similar and likely refer to the same concept in practice, even if there 
    are minor differences in wording, singular/plural form, or inclusion of generic words, as long as the 
    context and domain indicate they are used interchangeably.
-   Decide "no" only if there is clear and consistent evidence that the terms refer to different concepts or 
    ideas in <<{core_area}>>.
-   Do not guess or speculate, but allow for practical synonymy when the context and domain usage support it.



CONSTRAINTS:
-   Use only the provided context phrases plus general scientific knowledge of <<{core_area}>>.
-   If, in the context of <<{core_area}>>, it is clear from the provided context phrases and domain 
    knowledge that both terms consistently refer to the same concept, you must consider them conceptual 
    synonyms, even if not every phrase explicitly qualifies the term.
-   Minor differences in wording, singular/plural, or inclusion of generic words should not prevent synonymy 
    if the terms are used interchangeably in the domain.
-   For the same terms and context phrases, always return the same answer.
-   The decision should be robust to minor variations in context phrasing.


OUTPUT:
Return exactly one word with no quotes: "yes" or "no".


TERMS:
LEAD-TERM: <<{lead_term}>>
CANDIDATE-TERM: <<{candidate_term}>>


CONTEXT PHRASES FOR THE LEAD-TERM:
{contexts_lead}


CONTEXT PHRASES FOR THE CANDIDATE-TERM:
{contexts_candidate}
