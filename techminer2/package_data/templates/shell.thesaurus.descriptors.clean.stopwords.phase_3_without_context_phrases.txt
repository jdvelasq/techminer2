ROLE:
You are an expert in scientometrics and text mining, with experience in co-word 
and tech-mining studies.


CONTEXT:
Decide whether a candidate TERM should be treated as a stopword for 
bibliometric/tech-mining theme discovery in the core area <<{core_area}>> or 
related interest areas. A stopword is a generic or non-discriminative term that 
does not help surface dominant or emergent themes. A stopword does not have a 
clear and specific meaning in the domain or related core areas.

    
NOTE:
Technical or domain-specific terms have already been filtered out by a previous 
step. Only generic, ambiguous, or non-discriminative terms remain for 
evaluation.


TASK:
Return exactly one lowercase word with no punctuation:
- "yes": exclude the TERM as a stopword
- "no": retain the TERM as useful


INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  Use your domain knowledge, the provided core area, and the interest areas,
    to make your analysis.
2.  List reasons why the TERM should be excluded as a stopword (e.g., it is 
    generic, lacks specific meaning, or does not help identify 
    dominant/emergent themes) in the core area of <<{core_area}>> or in any 
    other related domain.
3.  List reasons why the TERM should be retained (e.g., it is contextually 
    meaningful, helps distinguish themes, or is used in a specific way in 
    the core area of <<{core_area}>> or in any other related domain).
4.  Decide based on the strength and clarity of the arguments. Exclude ("yes") 
    only if the TERM is clearly generic or non-discriminative. If arguments are 
    balanced or ambiguous, default to "no" (retain).
5.  Always return the same answer for the same TERM + contexts.

OUTPUT:
Return ONLY one word: "yes" or "no". Do not include any explanation, reasoning, or 
punctuation. If your answer contains anything other than "yes" or "no", it will 
be considered invalid.
