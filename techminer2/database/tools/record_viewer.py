    AB THE_FINANCIAL_SERVICES_INDUSTRY has been experiencing THE_RECENT_EMERGENCE
       of NEW_TECHNOLOGY_INNOVATIONS and PROCESS_DISRUPTIONS . THE_INDUSTRY overall
       , and MANY_FINTECH_START_UPS are looking for NEW_PATHWAYS to
       SUCCESSFUL_BUSINESS_MODELS , THE_CREATION of ENHANCED_CUSTOMER_EXPERIENCE ,
       and APPROACHES that result in SERVICES_TRANSFORMATION . INDUSTRY and
       ACADEMIC_OBSERVERS believe this to be more of A_REVOLUTION than A_SET of
       LESS_INFLUENTIAL_CHANGES , with FINANCIAL_SERVICES as A_WHOLE due for
       MAJOR_IMPROVEMENTS in EFFICIENCY , CUSTOMER_CENTRICITY , and INFORMEDNESS .
       THE_LONG_STANDING_DOMINANCE of LEADING_FIRMS that are not able to figure out
       how to effectively hook up with THE_FINTECH_REVOLUTION is at STAKE . we
       present A_NEW_FINTECH_INNOVATION_MAPPING_APPROACH that enables
       THE_ASSESSMENT of THE_EXTENT to which there are CHANGES and TRANSFORMATIONS
       in FOUR_AREAS of FINANCIAL_SERVICES . we discuss : OPERATIONS_MANAGEMENT in
       FINANCIAL_SERVICES and THE_CHANGES occurring . TECHNOLOGY_INNOVATIONS that
       have begun to leverage THE_EXECUTION and STAKEHOLDER_VALUE associated with
       PAYMENTS , CRYPTOCURRENCIES , BLOCKCHAIN , and CROSS_BORDER_PAYMENTS .
       MULTIPLE_INNOVATIONS that have affected LENDING_AND_DEPOSIT_SERVICES ,
       PEER_TO_PEER ( P2P ) LENDING , and SOCIAL_MEDIA_USE . ISSUES with_respect_to
       INVESTMENTS , FINANCIAL_MARKETS , TRADING , RISK_MANAGEMENT , ROBO_ADVISORY
