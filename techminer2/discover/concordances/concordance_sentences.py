    this_paper_explores THE_COMPLEXITY of FINTECH , and attempts A_DEFINITION , drawn from A_PROCESS of reviewing more than 200 scholarly articles referencing THE_TERM_FINTECH and covering A_PERIOD of more than 40 years .
    as THE_ORIGINS of THE_TERM can neither be unequivocally placed in ACADEMIA nor in PRACTICE , THE_DEFINITION concentrates on extracting out THE_QUINTESSENCE of FINTECH using BOTH_SPHERES .
    applying SEMANTIC_ANALYSIS and BUILDING on THE_COMMONALITIES of 13 peerreviewed DEFINITIONS of THE_TERM , it_is_concluded_that FINTECH is A_NEW_FINANCIAL_INDUSTRY that APPLIES_TECHNOLOGY to improve FINANCIAL_ACTIVITIES .
    this_research_represents A_STEPPING_STONE in exploring THE_INTERACTION between FINTECH and its yet unfolding SOCIAL_AND_POLITICAL_CONTEXT .
    THE_FINANCIAL_INDUSTRY has been strongly influenced by DIGITALIZATION in_the_past_few_years reflected by THE_EMERGENCE of ' ' FINTECH , ' ' which represents THE_MARRIAGE of ' ' FINANCE ' ' and ' ' INFORMATION_TECHNOLOGY . '
    ' FINTECH provides OPPORTUNITIES for THE_CREATION of NEW_SERVICES and BUSINESS_MODELS and poses CHALLENGES to TRADITIONAL_FINANCIAL_SERVICE_PROVIDERS .
    therefore , FINTECH has become A_SUBJECT of DEBATE among PRACTITIONERS , INVESTORS , and RESEARCHERS and is highly visible in THE_POPULAR_MEDIA .
    in_this_study , we unveil the drivers motivating the fintech phenomenon perceived by the english and german popular press including THE_SUBJECTS discussed in the context of FINTECH .
    in doing so , we extend THE_GROWING_KNOWLEDGE on FINTECH and contribute to A_COMMON_UNDERSTANDING in THE_FINANCIAL_AND_DIGITAL_INNOVATION_LITERATURE .
    , who explore THE_FIELD of FINTECH .
