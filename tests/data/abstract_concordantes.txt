There is currently no consensus about what the term FINTECH means. This paper explores the
complexity of FINTECH, and attempts a definition, drawn from a process of reviewing more
than 200 scholarly articles referencing the term FINTECH and covering a period of more
than 40 years. As the origins of the term can neither be unequivocally placed in academia
nor in practice, the definition concentrates on extracting out the quintessence of FINTECH
using both spheres. Applying semantic analysis and building on the commonalities of 13
peerreviewed definitions of the term, it is concluded that FINTECH is a new financial
industry that applies technology to improve financial activities.

Financial technologies (FINTECH) have become an integral part of banking, and nowadays
banks have started to compete beyond financial services facing increasing competition from
nonfinancial institutions providing, for example, payment services. The rapid rise of
FINTECH has changed the business landscape in banking asking for more innovative
solutions. These recent tendencies require the banks to increase investment in FINTECH,
rethink service distribution channels, especially the business-to-consumers models,
increase further standardization of backoffice functions, etc. Some members of the
financial services industry see the boom in FINTECH as a threat to traditional banking
industry. Others believe that FINTECH has become a challenge that can be turned into an
opportunity as it provides more flexibility, better functionality in some areas, and
aggregation of services. The aim of the paper is to analyze the recent trends in banking,
identifying opportunities and risks of FINTECH for banks. A timely integration of FINTECH
into business allows banks to get an advantage in growing competition. This paper provides
an extensive analysis of recent trends in FINTECH and banking, examining experience of
leading european and us banks, as well as surveys conducted among members of the financial
services industry in different countries. The authors have studied the development of the
financial innovation and technology market, assessed the existing practices applied in the
field of FINTECH, identified the main risks related to development of FINTECH and
financial innovations the banks are exposed to on the micro- and macrolevel. The paper
provides recommendations for regulators and banks to ensure reduction of risks associated
with development of FINTECH. Analysis of FINTECH market has shown growing competition,
including from nonfinancial institutions.

challenges that emerged when banks were encouraged to invest in FINTECH companies for
collaboration. This study aims to identify the strategic considerations in the process of
searching for FINTECH investment targets. The major data sources include the meeting notes

relate to: (1) the strategic goals of FINTECH investment, (2) the added value from FINTECH
companies, (3) criteria in selecting candidates in the same FINTECH area, (4) choosing to
work as either a cooperator or a competitor, and (5) barriers from policies and
regulations. (2) banks, technology companies, and customers are not FINTECH ready. (4)
banks and FINTECH companies have complex relationships. (5) it is unlikely that taiwan
will produce FINTECH disruptors in the near future. More studies are desired to observe

data on both the dollar-volume of funding and number of deals. Results: our results
indicate a positive relationship exists between the growth in FINTECH funding or deals and
the contemporaneous stock returns of incumbent retail banks. Conclusions: although these
results suggest complementarity between FINTECH and traditional banking, we note that our
results at the banking industry level are not statistically significant, and that the
coefficient signs for about one-third of the banks are negative, but not statistically
significant. Since the FINTECH industry is young and our sample period short, we cannot
rule out that our findings are spurious.

innovative technologies offered by FINTECH companies, analyses the advantages and
disadvantages of these services in comparison with services offered by the traditional
financial sector companies (banks, insurance companies, institutions involved in asset
management and investment, etc.), and evaluates how prepared are consumers to use FINTECH
services. This paper documents the results of the survey aiming to clarify how well-
informed consumers in latvia are about FINTECH services, their convenience, speed and
safety, as well as the consumers' current satisfaction with banking services. The
hypothesis of this paper is that latvian society is not ready to use services provided by
FINTECH, but prefers banking services instead. Survey results provide some evidence in
favour of this hypothesis: they show that respondents are generally unaware about FINTECH
services in latvia and their associated innovations and new financial products. This paper
makes several recommendations for managers of FINTECH enterprises, association of start-up

industry. The purpose of the paper is to investigate how financial services industry
participants perceive the effect of digital disruption as well as to explore what
strategies are being adopted by incumbents in the face of potential disruption from
FINTECH challengers. Based on an exploratory study with stakeholders from the financial
ecosystem in the middle east and north africa (mena), the findings show that the FINTECH
sector is still nascent, but is likely to be disruptive in selected product and customer
segments. Multiple regulatory, structural, and cultural obstacles stand in the way of

Design/methodology/approach: with a literature review on the global regulatory environment
and the underlying risks related to FINTECH, it looks into the formulation and
implementation of complementary regulatory policies in the case of hong kong as a gfc.
Findings: adopting a strategic approach that seizes opportunities associated with FINTECH,
the financial regulator harnesses comprehensive risk-based mechanisms to embrace exposures
to cyber risks while promoting institutionalization of cybersecurity among the regulated
firms with strategic controls. This study suggests a pathway for the evolution of a
profession with both technical and ethical competence for mitigating the emerging risks
arising from FINTECH. However, such an approach is yet to be tested with respect to
efficacy for the unexplored territories of fraud exposures, resulting from swift FINTECH
developments across borders. Research limitations/implications: as FINTECH has only
emerged rapidly in the recent years, it is not conclusive in this review of performance
and effectiveness of the financial regulator in its strategic approach. Originality/value:
this study reveals a strategic approach adopted by an emerged gfc in embracing FINTECH
innovation that however brings about unidentified risks and potential frauds to its

Online supply-chain financing has been a relatively novel funding channel for suppliers as
small-and medium-sized enterprises (smes) to obtain loans in that the revolution of
financial technology (FINTECH) transforms traditional supply-chain financing, which used
to be administered only by official banks, to an online model also used by electronic
commerce platforms (e-commerce platform). Endeavours towards financial inclusion of the
underserved smes could rationalize why we should allow for or encourage FINTECH
innovations exemplified by the online supply-chain financing mentioned above. What would
be an adaptive regulatory regime for such innovative FINTECH-enabled financial services as
the online supply-chain financing? within our conceptual framework to regulate the FINTECH
industry at the early stage, rather than rigorous rules traditionally placed on large
financial institutions, a principles-based strategy should be adopted to strike a balance
between financial stability and access to financial services advanced by disruptive

Leveraging digital technologies to offer innovative services, FINTECH start-ups are
emerging in domains such as asset management, lending, or insurance. Despite increasing
investments, the FINTECH phenomenon is low on theoretical insights. So far, the offerings
of FINTECH start-ups have been predominantly investigated from a functional perspective.
As a functional perspective does not suffice to fully understand the offerings of FINTECH
start-ups, we propose a taxonomy of non-functional characteristics. Thereby, we restrict
our analysis to consumer-oriented FINTECH start-ups. We demonstrate the applicability of
our taxonomy by classifying the offerings of 227 FINTECH start-ups and by identifying
archetypes via a cluster analysis. Our taxonomy contributes to the descriptive knowledge
on FINTECH start-ups, enabling researchers and practitioners to analyze the service
offerings of FINTECH start-up in a structured manner.

Regulation has failed to take into account the rise of financial technology (or "FINTECH")
firms and the fundamental changes they have ushered in on a variety of fronts, from the
way that banking works, to the way that capital is raised, even to the very form of money
itself. In many ways, these risks can be greater than those presented by large
institutions because decentralized FINTECH markets are more vulnerable to adverse economic
shocks, less transparent to regulators, and more likely to encourage excessively risky
behavior by market participants. The article concludes by sketching out a variety of
regulatory responses that better correspond to FINTECH's particular risks and rewards.

Manuscript type: empirical research question/issue: where are FINTECH venture capital
investments taking place around the world? what is the role of institutional factors on
the international allocation of FINTECH venture capital? research findings/insights: we
document a notable change in the pattern of FINTECH venture capital (vc) investments
around the world relative to other types of investments after the global financial crisis.
We show that FINTECH venture capital investments are relatively more common in countries
with weaker regulatory enforcement and without a major financial center after the
financial crisis. Also, we show the FINTECH boom is more pronounced for smaller private
limited partnership venture capitalists that likely have less experience with prior
venture capital booms and busts. These FINTECH vc deals are substantially more likely to
be liquidated, especially when located in countries without a major financial center. We
argue that the spike in FINTECH venture capital in certain countries is attributable to
differential enforcement of financial institution rules amongst startups versus large
established financial institutions after the financial crisis. Practitioner/policy
implications: regulatory arbitrage in the context of FINTECH venture capital can spur
booms and busts.

The advancement of mobile devices and their usage have increased the uptake of financial
technology (FINTECH) innovation. Financial sectors and startups see FINTECH as a gateway
to increase business opportunities, but mobile applications and other technology platforms
must be launched to explore such opportunities. Mobile application security threats have
increased tremendously and have become a challenge for both users and FINTECH innovators.
In this paper, the authors empirically inspect the components that influence the
expectations of both users and organizations to adopt FINTECH, such as customer trust,
data security, value added, user interface design and FINTECH promotion. The empirical
results definitely confirm that data security, customer trust and the user design
interface affect the adoption of FINTECH. The outcomes of this study can be used to
improve the performance of FINTECH strategies and enable banks to achieve economies of
scale for global intensity. Design/methodology/approach: in this paper, the authors
empirically consider factors that influence the expectations of both users and
organizations in adopting FINTECH, such as customer trust, data security, value added, the
user design interface and FINTECH promotion. The results confirm that customer trust, data
security and the user design interface affect the adoption of FINTECH. This research
proposes a model called intention to adopt FINTECH in germany, constructs of which were
developed based on the tam and five additional components, as identified. The outcomes of
this study can be used to improve the performance of FINTECH strategies and enable banks
to achieve economies of scale for global intensity. Yet the adoption of FINTECH is
extremely sluggish. It is intriguing to reckon that 99 per cent of respondents had mobile
devices, but only 10 per cent recognized FINTECH. Further, it is significantly
discouraging to perceive that only 10 of the 209 respondents had ever used FINTECH
services, representing under 1 per cent of the surveyed respondents. It is obvious that
the FINTECH incubators and banks offering FINTECH services need to persuade their
customers regarding the usefulness and value added advantages of FINTECH. This study has
been carried out to determine the key factors that influence and provoke FINTECH adoption.
Initially, this study focuses on FINTECH implementation in germany and not the whole of
europe. In addition, demographic and regional factors could be consolidated to inspect
their particular impact on the intention to use FINTECH services, particularly among
younger users with a high interest in technology. Without these constraints, the authors
could have gathered additional data for a more robust result and obtained new knowledge to
further upgrade polices to enhance the FINTECH adoption process. The authors could also
alleviate some limitations by examining how online vendors are performing with regard to
FINTECH to satisfy the needs of customers via case studies. For instance, the authors
suspect that the results would be somewhat different, were the research to be conducted in
the united kingdom, where take-up of FINTECH appears to be far greater than in germany.
Furthermore, respondents may have been influenced by past experiences about FINTECH usage
which might have led them to neglect to answer some questions. In spite of this, this
study did not consider the influence of moderating variables such as age, education and
FINTECH services experience. Accordingly, the authors could not quantify social impact and
control factors on FINTECH use. Social implications: the outcomes of this study can be
used to improve the performance of FINTECH strategies and enable banks to accomplish
economies of scale for global intensity. The authors do hope that this paper will serve to
encourage FINTECH innovators in their approach to FINTECH and enable FINTECH researchers
to use past work with more prominent certainty, resulting in rigid hypothesis improvement
in the future.

crowdfunding and peer-to-peer (p2p) lending. In this paper, we examine the determinants of
the use of FINTECH finance by businesses, with a particular focus on the ownership,
governance, and business practices that may modify the relationships with conventional
motivations for external finance. Using a comprehensive sample of chinese hi-tech small
and medium-sized enterprises (smes), we find that state-owned enterprises (soes) and
family firms and financially constrained firms are respectively much less and much more
likely to seek FINTECH finance. The quality of traditional relationship banking also
affects the relative desirability of FINTECH financing. As for family firms, we find that
innovation, as exemplified by rd activity, effectively overrides any conventional
reluctance to access external finance, suggesting the relative benefits of FINTECH finance
for innovative high-growth firms.

Changing the traditional financial services concept, FINTECH companies formed a new niche
within the financial services market, the dynamic development of which determines the
relevance of the development and implementation of an effective regulatory and oversight
system. The purpose of the article is to develop an economic and mathematical model for
forecasting the development of the FINTECH market on the example of ukraine. In order to
study the development of the FINTECH industry, a multiple regression model was presented.
The model describes the dependence of the total investment value of FINTECH from venture
investments in financial technology, venture investments in other technologies and venture
investments in online lending. Based on this model, the effect of attracting investments
with new FINTECH projects on the total volume of investments in the industry was

total rate of venture investments decreases by 0.03, funds in new projects of other
companies grow by 0.05, and venture investments in online lending increase by 0.89.
According to the analysis of regulatory legislation in the foreign countries of the

We investigate the economic and technological determinants inducing entrepreneurs to
establish ventures with the purpose of reinventing financial technology (FINTECH). We find
that countries witness more FINTECH startup formations when the economy is well-developed
and venture capital is readily available. Finally, the more difficult it is for companies
to access loans, the higher is the number of FINTECH startups in a country. Overall, the
evidence suggests that FINTECH startup formation need not be left to chance, but active
policies can influence the emergence of this new sector.

Along with the development of FINTECH, many scholars have studied how information
technology is applied to financial services with a focus on extended methods for
application. Few scholars have studied the influence mechanism behind the adoption of
FINTECH services. This paper proposes an improved technology acceptance model (tam) that
incorporates user innovativeness, government support, brand image, and perceived risk as
determinants of trust to investigate how users adopt FINTECH services. The results reveal
that users' trust in FINTECH services has a very significant influence on users' attitudes
for adoption. In addition, perceived ease of use and perceived risk does not affect users'
attitudes toward the adoption regarding FINTECH services. This study contributes to the
literature of the adoption of FINTECH services by providing a more comprehensive view of
the determinants of users' attitudes by combining trust of FINTECH services with tam.

FINTECH is the hottest topic in finance today. Less visibly, FINTECH is also changing the
way we think about finance: it is gradually recasting our collective understanding of the
financial system in normatively neutral terms of applied information science. By making
financial transactions easier, faster, and cheaper, FINTECH seems to promise a micro-level
"win-win " solution to the financial system's many ills. This article challenges such
narratives and presents an alternative account of FINTECH as a systemic, macro-level
phenomenon. Grounding the analysis of evolving FINTECH trends in a broader institutional
context, the article exposes the normative and political significance of FINTECH as the
catalyst for a potentially decisive shift in the underlying public-private balance of
powers, competencies, and roles in the financial system. Finally, the article shows how
and why specific FINTECH applications-cryptocurrencies, distributed ledger technologies,
digital crowdfunding, and robo-advising-are poised to amplify the effect of these
destabilizing mechanisms, and thus potentially exacerbate the tensions and imbalances in
today's financial markets and the broader economy. It is this potential that renders
FINTECH a public policy challenge of the highest order.

This paper examines the feasibility of FINTECH as a platform for sustainable economic
growth and as a prompter of the fourth industrial revolution. To analyze the role of
FINTECH in the national economy, we first broaden its definition and compare its economic
performance using three methodologies-demand-driven model, supply-driven model and
industry linkage effect in interindustry analysis. We find that the FINTECH industry has a
stronger effect on production inducement. Regarding industry linkage effects, FINTECH
ranked the top in all 31 industries for the forward linkage effect and 22 for the
background linkage effect-much higher than the traditional financial industry. This
implies that the FINTECH industry is effective as the intermediate good with national
demand as well as the final good. That is, FINTECH could better promote overall national
economic performance as a platform industry. Because most businesses within the FINTECH
industry depend on innovation through the integration of finance and information
technology, we find that FINTECH can feasibly prompt the fourth industrial revolution.
Nonetheless, this industry is characterized by excessive regulations in korea, indicating
the need for negative regulation for new, innovative businesses within the FINTECH
industry that would critically emphasize innovativeness for inclusive, sustainable
economic growth.

pollution. On the other hand, in the developed stage of an agricultural economy, the
impact of FINTECH development and its structure on agricultural nps pollution is
insignificant. Hence, we can conclude that FINTECH development can help reduce
agricultural nps pollution in under-developed regions. However, due to the fact that a u
shape relationship always exists between FINTECH service quality and agricultural nps
pollution, the quality of FINTECH service should be the main focus to reduce agricultural
nps pollution more effectively.

The term FINTECH emerged in 1972, as an acronym of financial technologies, is often
described as amalgamation of financial services using technological evolutions, and its
usage was earlier limited to banking sector deploying modern management science and
computers (bettinger, 1972, p.62). FINTECH was mainly restricted to back-office processes
of banks leveraging software and applications to manage customer accounts and their
transactions in a secured, centralized, and efficient way. Micu (2016), referred FINTECH
as a new paradigm of technology to facilitate business, international trade, and services
offered to retail consumers. Schueffel (2016) conceptualized FINTECH as a technological
encapsulation of financial sector rather than a technology. Smartphones with high speed

the covid-19 pandemic. The research empirically examines the factors affecting jordanian
citizens intention to use FINTECH applications. The sample of the research comprised 500
potential FINTECH service users in jordan. The research results indicate that perceived
benefits and social norms significantly affect the intention to use FINTECH applications.
However, it has been found that perceived technology risks do not significantly affect the
intention to use FINTECH applications. Moreover, the results also indicate that customer
trust is significantly mediating the relationship between perceived risks and intention to
use FINTECH applications. FINTECH service providers should insure that their products are
easy to use, fulfill needs and protect consumers data in order to ensure trust, hence
positively influencing consumer adoption.

Purpose: this study aims to explore the existing islamic financial technology (FINTECH)
lending in indonesia. Doing so is to better understand in what way the FINTECH firms have
been promoting the global movement of sustainable development goals (sdgs) in the local
context. This paper first reviews relevant literature related to FINTECH and establishes
the substantive definition of islamic FINTECH. Following this, the official reports from
the domestic regulators are referred to select the FINTECH firms which meet the criteria
of islamic FINTECH lending based on the proposed definition. Findings: this work finds
that the reviewed FINTECH firms have been promoting the idea of financial inclusion, for
example, financing the underdeveloped sectors such as agriculture and small and micro
enterprises (smes). Furthermore, the selected FINTECH firms are also found to collect and
distribute islamic social funds such as infaq (charity spending), waqf (endowment) and
sadaqah (voluntary charity). Practical implications: the indonesian government is advised
to legally engage with the existing FINTECH firms and other related stakeholders to best
solve its recent issue of the declining trend in sdg 15 (life on land). Social
implications: this work elaborates in what way the islamic FINTECH lending has been
promoting the sdgs in indonesian context. In some extent, such discussion can best
challenge the social issue of FINTECH which has been stigmatised of bringing mafsadah
(harm), as subjectively claimed by one particular religious group in indonesia.
Originality/value: this study is among the pioneers which offers the definition of islamic
FINTECH and further explains its position in endorsing the global movement of sdgs.

financial services, particularly for sections of the population formerly excluded from
such services. This paper is among the first to investigate the effect of FINTECH
development on urbanization, as indicated by labor transfer from agricultural to non-
agricultural sectors in china. It is found that: (i) the digital divide hindered, while
FINTECH development contributed to urbanization. (ii) the positive effect of FINTECH
development on urbanization affects individuals both with and without access to the

FINTECH and digital financial services involve the delivery of financial products and
services through technology. FINTECH companies are part of a financial lending
infrastructure claiming to offer an alternative to big banks, and are often touted as
digitally disruptive technology that is rapidly reshaping financial inclusion agendas and
improving the lives of the poor. For many refugees living in camps and informal
settlements in kenya, FINTECH is often the only viable option for credit or microfinance
aid. While refugees are often excluded from credit, the spread of FINTECH as a solution
for direct peer-to-peer aid transfers from the global north to refugees has resulted in
the uneven distribution of credit access and livelihood support. Through FINTECH, private
citizens and groups in the global north are able to disrupt and subvert refugee
assistance, deeming some worthy of aid while others face ongoing exclusion. While FINTECH
remains a hopeful source of greater efficiency and empowerment, the direct transfer of aid
money masks profit and corporate power by only extending assistance to those refugees who
are appropriately entrepreneurial, that is to say those who will start small businesses
and pay back their loans. This paper argues that processes of financial inclusion carried
out by and through FINTECH are still distinguished largely by exclusion.

Despite high expectations for the growth of FINTECH, it has not reached the expected
growth in the real world. As FINTECH is innovative but inherently unpredictable, customers
are still hesitant to adopt and use FINTECH, which ultimately affects its growth. To
achieve the sustainable development and growth of FINTECH, an in-depth investigation of
FINTECH continuance intentions is required. To investigate continuous-use behavior in a
FINTECH context, this study focuses on two relevant issues: uncertainty and information
technology (it) quality. Uncertainty is more critical in FINTECH than in traditional
e-banking transactions because FINTECH transactions are complicated and less predictable.
It quality is also crucial to FINTECH success because it plays a key role in FINTECH
transactions. This study mainly explores the relationship between uncertainty and it
quality, both of which significantly affect FINTECH continuance intentions. For the
purpose, we integrated an it quality-based perspective with a trust-based model to
investigate FINTECH continuance intentions. Service quality is the most important quality
factor for controlling uncertainty and encouraging continued use of FINTECH. We found a
more extended role of it in FINTECH than in other digital services. This study provides
FINTECH providers with the practical guidance in the design and implementation of FINTECH
innovation, thereby achieving the sustainable development of FINTECH.

This essay examines the current transformation of the chinese financial sector and the
implications of chinese financial technology (FINTECH) development for countries in
southeast asia. Main argument china is home to some of the world's most innovative FINTECH
companies. Chinese FINTECH companies have been successful in promoting financial inclusion
and integration in their home country and are attempting to replicate this success in
southeast asian markets. The rapid development of the chinese FINTECH industry can be
attributed to various factors, including a high degree of technological savvy among
chinese consumers, underdeveloped banking systems, a FINTECH-friendly regulatory
environment, and china's improving scientific and technological prowess. Geographic
proximity as well as ethnic and cultural connections between china and southeast asia are
also major facilitators that can help chinese FINTECH companies succeed in the region. Due
to the absence of these constraints in southeast asian markets, china's FINTECH firms are
emerging as major competitors. Many chinese FINTECH programs perform poorly with regard to
security and privacy practices, which should be an issue of concern as they gain access to
new markets. Western and other advanced economies such as japan must make special efforts
to bring institutional changes to southeast asian markets for FINTECH products, especially
in the areas of data privacy, cybersecurity, and surveillance. If consumers understand
such risks, they are more likely to prefer FINTECH services provided by japanese and
western firms.

of FINTECH firms and compare it with their counterparts. Design/methodology/approach: by
using on a dataset from 46 countries between 2009 and 2018, the authors use five measures
of var to investigate their empirical dynamics in relation with the market value of
FINTECH and non-FINTECH companies. Findings: the empirical results indicate that FINTECH
firms' portfolios have a higher financial risk and a higher market value in comparison to
non-FINTECH firms' portfolios. Furthermore, the authors also report that the FINTECH firm
portfolios experience more financial risk regardless of the holding period as long-term
(one year) or short-term (quarter). This research does not segregate FINTECH firms into
their different types of services, such as direct financial investment services, loan
provision services, insurance services (insurtech), etc. The authors only aggregate the
FINTECH firms by country and region. Future research may consider analysing FINTECH firms
by differentiating the kind of financial services they offer practical implications: given
the importance of their market value, the results imply that FINTECH companies might
contribute significantly to financial fluctuations in case of large variations of the
market. In terms of policy recommendation, this observation requires a particular
attention from the regulatory bodies who need to find the best economic balance between
promoting innovation/financial technology and regulating the FINTECH companies.
Originality/value: this paper is the first study clarifying the relation of financial risk

regional knowledge creation and lack of trust in financial services incumbents across 21
oecd countries, 226 regions and over the 20072014 period. We find that knowledge generated
in the it sector is much more salient for fostering new FINTECH start-ups than knowledge
generated in the financial services sector. Additionally, the importance of new knowledge
created in the financial services sector (it sector) increases (decreases) as FINTECH
start-ups grow and seek financing. When the level of trust in financial services
incumbents falls within a region, this is followed by an increase in the financing
provided to FINTECH start-ups. Nevertheless, regions with historically low average levels
of trust in financial services incumbents attract less FINTECH investment overall.

This paper represents an early attempt to investigate the growth and distributional
effects of FINTECH development, using household survey data from china. China's rapid
expansion of FINTECH in the past decade has significantly improved the accessibility and
affordability of financial services, particularly for formerly financially excluded
population groups. Linking the index of digital financial inclusion with china family
panel studies (cfps) data, we find that FINTECH development is positively correlated with
household income, and the positive effect is larger for rural households than the urban
counterpart, suggesting that FINTECH development has helped narrow the urban-rural income
gap. Moreover, the poor gain more than the rich from FINTECH development in rural china,
indicating its benign distributive impacts within rural china.

treasurys strategy is determined to ensure britain remains the best place in the world to
set up and grow a FINTECH business. The financial conduct authoritys sandbox regime has
attracted FINTECH start-ups from around the world to test their technology and business
with supervision and regulatory protections, providing an opportunity to grow into major
businesses. The success of the intuitive sandbox has however led to it being replicated in
jurisdictions worldwide, eager to benefit from the growth of FINTECH. Competition for
high-calibre start-ups means the uks post-brexit sandbox may need to go further than its

This article examines FINTECH as a systemic force disrupting the currently dominant
technocratic paradigm of financial regulation. It offers a five-part taxonomy of (i) the
key FINTECH-driven changes in the structure and operation of today's financial system, and
(ii) the corresponding challenges these systemic shifts pose to the continuing efficacy of
the regulatory enterprise as it exists today. This exercise reveals the fundamental
tension at the core of the FINTECH problem. In the FINTECH era, the financial system as a
whole is growing ever bigger, moving ever faster, and getting ever more complex and
difficult to manage. Surveying the presently fragmented efforts to regulate FINTECH, this
article highlights the limiting effects of the technocratic bias built into their design.
Against that background, it outlines several alternative reform options that would
explicitly target the core macro-structural, as opposed to micro-transactional, aspects of
the FINTECH challenge- a nd do so in a more assertive, comprehensive, and normatively
unified manner.

This paper explores the most recent FINTECH (financial technology) phenomenon from an
ecosystem perspective. Differentiated from the earlier FINTECH evolution led by
traditional financial institutions, cross-sector FINTECH that operates at the intersection
of financial services and information technology disrupts existing business models of
banks while creating novel ecosystem dynamics. This study explores the FINTECH ecosystem
composition to understand better business model innovation based on underlying ecosystem
dynamics while focusing on the specific role of cross-sector actors. Adopting a
comparative case study method by considering the china-based alibaba group and tencent,
the studys findings indicate that novel business model developments based on strong
technological expertise and scale-based resources by cross-sector FINTECH render a
functional perspective on fast-developing FINTECH industry less practical. Apart from
cross-sector FINTECH, investors constitute a new dimension in the conceptualization of the
FINTECH ecosystem. Overall, the interconnectedness of the cross-sector FINTECH beyond the
FINTECH sectors drives the fuzzy boundaries between ecosystems, established business
models, terminology definitions, ecosystem actors roles and relationships, which appear to
become more heterogeneous and changeable over time. The study contributes to the scant
literature on FINTECH ecosystems and their sustainable development.

The extent of financial exclusion in africa drives the adoption of FINTECH across the
continent, but the disruption it can cause hinders progress. This study therefore assesses
both the probability and actual rates of FINTECH adoption in 32 african economies between
2002 and 2018. Based on the information spill-over and rank theories, multiple logistic
regression analysis revealed that the average probability of FINTECH adoption for all,
emerging and frontier african economies to be 50.9%, 83.1%, and 23.1%, respectively,
whereas the actual rates are 27%, 40%, and 29%, respectively. The fragile economies,
however, had no reasonable probability or actual rates of FINTECH adoption. Thus, it is
concluded that emerging economies and mobile phone banking drive FINTECH adoption in
africa, and is largely dependent mainly on structural changes rather than economic and
financial factors. The current study consequently recommends improved literacy, ict

Financial technology, or FINTECH, has recently attracted considerable attention both in
the financial industry and academia. Despite the broad application of FINTECH, little
academic research has explored the development of this new wave of technological
innovations. Our study aims to identify, classify, and track the development of FINTECH
innovations using patent data. A difficulty is that there are no accurate international
patent classification (ipc) codes that we can refer to as FINTECH innovations. Hence, in
this paper we provide a comprehensive method for identifying FINTECH patents. We first use
a text-based filtering technique to locate potential FINTECH patents and get a data set
comprising 37,156 records. We then construct a training sample of FINTECH patents by
reading those patent files manually. Next, textual analysis and machine-learning
techniques are applied to identify all FINTECH patents in the whole data set, based on the
initial sample. We classify FINTECH patents into seven categories according to the key
underlying technologies and track the development of each category. Thus a whole picture
of FINTECH innovations is formed.

The presence of FINTECH as an innovative and disruptive financial service can improve the
efficiency and scope of financial services through the application of technology. FINTECH
is considered to have various benefits. However, based on survey conducted by dailysocial
and otoritas jasa keuangan finds that the FINTECH adoption rate in indonesia is still
relatively low at around 58.1%, this is in line with a penetration level of FINTECH in
asia which indonesia usage level still in 5% compared to china, hong kong, and india. In
determining FINTECH adoption, users tend to do rational calculations by comparing the
perceived benefits and risks and will decide to adopt them when the perceived benefits are
greater than the risks received. According to some studies, trust can be mediated to
reduce some level of risk, thus this study will also include trust variables in the risk-
benefit framework to determine user adoption intention on FINTECH services in indonesia.
Based on data collected from 100 FINTECH users, this study initially investigated whether
perceived benefits and risks significantly impacted FINTECH adoption intention. As a
resulting trust, economic benefit and convenience are proven to significantly influence
the user to adopt FINTECH. The hypothesis testing indicates that security risk has the
biggest negative effect and convenience has the biggest positive effect on FINTECH
adoption intention.

Purpose: the aim of the paper is to develop the approach to a legal definition of FINTECH.
Design/methodology/approach: in this paper we evolve possible approaches of FINTECH legal
definition, investigate existing approaches at the international level and examine the
policies applied at the national levels. Findings: we found that in most countries the
legislation does not specifically address FINTECH companies, and the legal framework
equally regulates the activities of traditional service providers and FINTECH operators.
In our opinion, no specific legislation for FINTECH companies needed, each type of
activity provided by a financial or technology company is subject to a specific
legislation/regulation with primary focus on services and products provided as payments,
insurance, investments etc. Practical implications: the term FINTECH is freely used by
policy makers, regulators, companies, researchers, academics and the public, both

While both concepts have been researched in recent years, their intersection, often
conceived as green FINTECH, remains underdetermined. Therefore, this paper contributes to
this important discussion about green FINTECH by, first, synthesizing the relevant
literature systematically. Second, it shows the results of an empirical, in-depth analysis
of the swiss FINTECH landscape both in terms of green FINTECH startups as well as the
services offered by the incumbents. The research results show that literature in this new
domain has only emerged recently, is mostly characterized by a specific focus on isolated
aspects of green FINTECH and does not provide a comprehensive perspective on the topic
yet. In addition, the results from the literature and the market analysis indicate that
green FINTECH has an impact along the whole value chain of financial services covering

This article reviews critically the recent eu legislation and proposals for the regulation
of financial technology (FINTECH) and makes recommendations for legal improvements in the
proposed frameworks, which will help to accelerate FINTECH growth, a declared eu goal, in
the years to come. The rise of FINTECH driven by nonbank entities (technology startups,
finance, big tech and big retail companies) helps to transform financial services
industry, but also threatens the market positions of traditional banks and through them
potentially the stability of the financial system. The current eu proposals, as presented
in the commissions FINTECH action plan published in 2018 and follow-up measures, outlined
a number of steps to support FINTECH, while ensuring the protection of market stability
and consumers and the maintenance of level playing field in the financial services
markets. The article argues that, while the commissions proposed policy mix contains
certain positive measures for FINTECH, it remains, overall, conservative and favours the
incumbents. It also argues that unless the commission becomes bolder and adopts a more
flexible legal framework for FINTECH (for which the article makes specific
recommendations), the latter will not grow at the pace needed to help build a competitive
advantage for the eu financial sector.

Open innovation between critical stakeholders in the emerging FINTECH industry brings
about positive results to improve financing needs of this huge segment of the market that
ranges from those underserved by banks because of credit risk, to migrants and refugees.
Despite the introduction of disruptive FINTECH services, the needs generated by unimproved
conditions and protracted crises outstrip the resources available to meet them. Islamic
FINTECH has the potential to solve this problem through its mandatory (zakat), voluntary
(waqf and sadaqah) philanthropic principles, as well as its encouragement to fostering the
culture of science, technology, and advancement, in forming a steady pool of resources to
enable financial inclusion. This research employs literature review, conceptual analysis
and qualitative case study methodology to provide an overview of how FINTECH start-ups in
finland and malaysia facilitate financial inclusion through the illustration of two major
FINTECH sectors, namely e-marketplace/payments and crowdfunding/peer-to-peer (p2p)
financing. We synthesize that open innovation further enhances FINTECH services to elevate
social finance from its current infrastructure to a more sustainable outcome-base funding,
changing the way capital could be mobilized for social impact. Our findings also suggest
that islamic FINTECH offers an effective and efficient alternative to raising funds in the
backdrop of financing the underserved individuals, while providing a knowledge-based
platform that enhances customer-service provider intimacy to guide future social finance
decisions.

FINTECH risks have a special type of structure and formation mechanism. China's FINTECH
development is leading the world, but its lagging legal development does not match its
rank in the field. Due to the difficult co-ordination of regulatory goals, unclear
allocation of regulatory power, insufficient risk identification, and incomplete
regulation tools, china's legal governance on FINTECH risks has been swinging between the
paths of suppressive, indulging, and adaptive regulation. It is urgently necessary to
follow the FINTECH-risk law and fully tap into the local resources and explore the
intervening path with more proactivity, foresight, and refined characteristics, through
specification of the legal status and governing power of the intervening entity, the
institutional basis and legal effect of interventional means, and the governing key and
constitutional rules of intervening objects, to establish a legal-governance system on
FINTECH risks that is innovation-friendly, regulatorily effective, and safe at the bottom
line, fully covering the whole process.

If the ambition of FINTECH start-ups to create superior screening and monitoring
technologies materialises, this advantage would be diminished and regional banks would
become superfluous for small firm finance. Though FINTECH's scoring technologies may
overcome the first limitation, it appears likely that in the course of scoring development
real soft information will be systematically crowded out due to the manipulation problem.
The paper expects improved access to finance for smes if FINTECH solutions overcome both
limitations of real soft information use, or if peer-to-peer lending and regional banks
coexist. Deteriorated access to finance is expected if FINTECH companies displace the
relationship banking of regional banks due to enhanced competition, without preserving the
advantages of real soft information with superior screening and monitoring technologies.
The paper concludes with recommendations on how to prevent deteriorated access to finance
for small firms by promoting fair competition and FINTECH innovations.

Financial technologies (FINTECH) are gaining popularity amongst organizations due to its
ability in improving their competitiveness. As a result, organizations are seeking ways in
the development of FINTECH projects. The performance evaluation of the most suitable
FINTECH project, however, is complex and challenging due to the involvement of multiple
decision makers, the multi-dimensional nature of the evaluation process and the presence
of vagueness and imprecision inherent in the human decision making process. To deal with
this problem, this paper presents a multicriteria group decision making approach for
evaluating the performance of FINTECH projects. A multicriteria group decision making
approach is developed for calculating an overall performance index for every FINTECH
project alternative across all criteria. A FINTECH project performance evaluation problem

Purpose: this paper analyzes banking sector earnings management using loan loss provisions
(llps) in the FINTECH era. Design/methodology/approach: regression methodology was used to
examine earnings management in the FINTECH era. There is greater income smoothing in the
second-wave FINTECH era compared to the first-wave FINTECH era, and the presence of strong
institutions did not lower income smoothing in the second-wave era. Bank income smoothing
is also greater in (1) bank of international settlement (bis) and eu countries than in
non-eu countries and g7 countries, (2) well-capitalized banking sectors and (3) during
economic booms in the second-wave FINTECH era. Practical implications: the competition for
loans and deposits by banks and FINTECH lenders in the second-wave FINTECH era created
additional incentives for banks to engage in income smoothing to report competitive and
stable earnings. Also, this study extends the bank earnings management literature by
introducing the FINTECH era as a determinant of the extent of bank earnings management.

This can be guaranteed if the islamic banking system introduces the technology, often
known as FINTECH interest-free foreign exchange bank machines (iffexbm), which will
automatically dispense bd10 for dh100 and vice-versa, both locally and globally, and it
will have tremendous positive effects in the economy. Furthermore, the effects of
introducing FINTECH for eliminating riba will be analyzed on economic and international
trade activities by using aggregate expenditure (ae) and aggregate output model within the
tenets of islamic principles. Findings: if islamic banks (ibs) can introduce FINTECH
global network system where any client can buy or sell foreign currency at the same rate
without any markup, it will increase the market share for ibs by increasing the number of

non-white applicants and between neighborhoods of varying racial composition in the united
states 200 largest metropolitan areas at FINTECH and traditional lenders. Results of a
series of binary logistic regression models suggest disparities in rates of loan approvals
between white and similarly qualified non-white applicants are substantively small
overall, but lower at FINTECH lenders relative to traditional lenders, most substantially
for latinos. Non-white applicants are more likely to receive subprime terms relative to
similarly qualified white applicants at both lender types, and disparities in rates of
subprime loan receipt between black and similarly qualified white applicants are greater
at FINTECH lenders than traditional lenders. Findings suggest FINTECH lending contributes
to racial and spatial disparities in subprime mortgage lending and warrants increased

To explore whether these risks can be alleviated by FINTECH and study its specific
mechanism from the perspective of managers, we investigate on a sample from the
establishment of FINTECH subsidiaries in chinese commercial banks during 20142018. The
results show that FINTECH can alleviate pre-loan risk associated with credit activities,
and this negative effect is more pronounced in banks with higher level of managerial
ownership. As the control of post-loan risk is more dependent on the regulators, FINTECH
in banks has no significant effect on reducing post-loan risk associated with credit

similar as in other countries: crowdfunding, cryptocurrency, blockchain, ai, big data, and
cashless payments. What has been the largest impact of FINTECH in japan? at first glance,
FINTECH seems to require a change in the financial regulation framework, but this is not
the case. Of course, some other new financial businesses appeared before FINTECH, and
regulation responded to the new risk. FINTECH is not a completely new business but just
the unbundling of current financial businesses. Especially, payment became more
independent from banking today, thanks to the FINTECH movement. It seems FINTECH requires
a change in the basic framework of financial law. But both in practice and in theory, a
pure payment service has attracted attention before FINTECH. Therefore, FINTECH, or any

clarification of current law.

effect brought about by prosperous FINTECH is more salient in banks with larger sizes,
lower efficiency, more shadow banking business and more interest-based income. Moreover,
the nexus between FINTECH and banks risk taking is a u-shaped trend, with FINTECH
initially intensifying and then weakening banks risk taking.

The purpose of this research is to define the level of significance for various indicators
that influence the degree of consumer satisfaction regarding the use of FINTECH
technologies and services. The most important factors that influence the level of
satisfaction when using FINTECH services were considered: comfort and ease of use, legal
regulations, ease of account opening, mobile payments features, crowdfunding options,
international money transfers features, reduced costs associated with transactions, peer-
to-peer lending, insurances options, online brokerage, cryptocoins options and exchange
options. The values of the indicators for different categories of users of FINTECH
services and different categories of generations can be determined based on the
statistical tests performed and the results obtained from the regression analysis. The
values of the indicators are the basic elements for determining the regression model that
will help the FINTECH service vendors to make personalized decisions for each category of
users so that the level of customer satisfaction is maximized. The results of the article
are relevant to both stakeholders and the scientific community that is concerned about the
impact of FINTECH technologies.

The FINTECH industry is gradually maturing and offers a wide range of financial services
on the global stage. Still, the understanding of FINTECH business models remains at its
infancy with a shortage of cross-country comparisons. This paper aims to determine the
differences in business model attributes of FINTECHs in five rapidly emerging FINTECH
hotspots in central and eastern europe (cee). Survey results from estonia, latvia,
lithuania, poland, and russia, accompanied by cluster analysis, enable us to provide
unique in-depth evidence on FINTECH business models. Across the selected countries, we
observe significant differences in the attributes of FINTECH business models: key
activities, key resources, value propositions, customer segments, delivery channels, cost
structure, and revenue stream. Although these clusters share similarities with FINTECH
archetypes proposed in previous research, they remain rather unevenly distributed across
countries.

This study aims to investigate the role of FINTECH in predicting the spread of covid-19
based on consumers' FINTECH perceptions and behavior before and after the outbreak of
covid-19. The study targeted consumers with FINTECH experience, especially in digital
payments services. These three variables (FINTECH behavior before covid-19, FINTECH
behavior after covid-19, and FINTECH perception after covid-19) could predict 52.5% of the
variance in the dependent variable (covid-19 spread) (r2 = 0.525, p &lt. The findings show
that higher FINTECH perception and behavior among FINTECH users will help in reducing the
spread of covid-19 by avoiding the use of contact payment methods. Contactless payment
methods are the main tools in FINTECH that might help in avoiding the probability of
covid-19 spread. Consumers' FINTECH perceptions and behavior are the most influencing
factors that could predict the spread of covid-19 in this study, where digital payments
are the main concern. Other researchers are also encouraged to use the same model to
predict the spread of this virus in the FINTECH context.

One of the major beneficiaries of the fourth industrial revolution is FINTECH. However,
despite the unprecedented growth of, investment in, and returns generated by this sector,
a conducive environment and FINTECH support ecosystem is essential to exploit the true
potential of FINTECH. The biggest challenge for many governments across the globe is not
only setting priorities in which FINTECH services to invest (e.g., digital wallets, peer-
to-peer lending, e-insurances) but also in which geographical area to invest. Since
technology is independent of physical interaction and geographical confinement,
governments face a dilemma: keep FINTECH growth geographically diverse or concentrated
within a few cities. This study evaluates the FINTECH success of countries with its spread
in different cities and attempts to formulate a policy direction to accelerate the wave of
the fourth industrial revolution. Our results suggest that rather than a widespread
presence, countries should concentrate their efforts, investment, and attention to
developing a FINTECH ecosystem in fewer cities to facilitate them as much as possible.
This concentrated effort could help countries improve their global FINTECH scores and
specialize in specific core areas.

paper also identifies the flaws in the existing regulations and policies on FINTECH, and
it also proposes an ideal framework for a FINTECH law as a strategy to strengthen consumer
protection and to accelerate the growth of the digital economy in indonesia. Findings: the
promising potential and growth of the FINTECH industry in indonesia need to be supported
by a sound legal framework in the form of indonesian law. In regards to FINTECH, indonesia
does not yet have a specific law on FINTECH. These reasons illustrate how urgently
indonesia needs FINTECH law. Research limitations/implications: this research only
examines the existing FINTECH regulations in indonesia. Practical implications: this
research is expected to be useful for the house of representatives of the republic of

authority (ojk) and bank of indonesia (bi) in drafting the FINTECH law. Social
implications: this research is expected to increase protection for consumers, investors
and providers of FINTECH services and accelerate the growth of the digital economy in
indonesia. Originality/value: regulating FINTECH in the indonesian law is meant to give
legal certainty and better legal protection for consumers, investors and providers of
FINTECH services. Seeing that the value of the indonesian digital economy in 2019 has
reached usd40bn (approximately idr586tn), indonesia is philosophically, juridically and

find that most FINTECHs are geographically clustered and that the location of new FINTECH
startups is affected, among other things, by the size of clusters and the presence of
incubators. Larger clusters attract more new FINTECH startups, and incubators are shown to
be an effective mechanism to attract new FINTECH startups. Increased competition within a

This study aims to highlight the current corporate governance issues which FINTECH firms
are facing. This line of enquiry is necessary as a majority of FINTECH firms are
collaborating with the listed firms, and quality corporate governance is vital to protect
the shareholders rights. FINTECH governance structure faces four key challenges: lack of
anti-misconduct policy, ceo duality, over-boarded directors, and the inability of audit
firms to detect fraud. Also, the supervisory structure of FINTECH firms is different than
counterparts, which hinder the audit firms to deduct any financial misstatement. Based on
the literature, we find that the FINTECH firms lack anti-bribery policy and prone to have
ceo duality, over-boarded directors and audit firms failure to detect fraud. It implies
that the FINTECH firms have embedded weak governance mechanisms, which will expropriate
the shareholders right after the listed firms collaboration. The governance issues are not

Within this context of digital transformation and sustainable finance, FINTECH has emerged
as an alternative to traditional financial institutions. This paper, through a literature
review and case study approach, analyzes the relationship between FINTECH and sustain-
ability, and the different areas of collaboration between FINTECH and sustainable finance,
from both a theoretical and descriptive perspective, while giving specific examples of
current technological platforms. Additionally, in this paper, two FINTECH initiatives
(clarity ai and pensumo) are described, as well as several proposals to improve the
detection of greenwashing and other deceptive behavior by firms. The results lead to the
conclusion that sustainable finance and FINTECH have many aspects in common, and that
FINTECH can make financial businesses more sustainable overall by promoting green finance.

This article focuses on the relationship between FINTECH and bank risk-taking behavior.
Since robo-advisor is one of the mature applications of FINTECH, we found that the
development of FINTECH will have a greater impact on small and medium-sized banks through
the establishment of a robo-advisor model. We found that the development of FINTECH has
significantly reduced bank risk-taking level. This result is still valid after the
robustness test of replacing the banks risk-taking index and replacing the FINTECH
development index. The test of the intermediary effect shows that the development of
FINTECH will affect the bank risk-taking through channels such as the banks internal
interest margin, management capabilities, the banks external competition intensity, and
residents saving willingness. Heterogeneity analysis shows the reduction effect of FINTECH
on bank risk-taking is more pronounced in banks in eastern and western regions in china,
the large banks and the urban commercial banks.

Financial technology (FINTECH) has flourished in recent years. From 2008 to 2016, the
global investment in FINTECH increased more than threefold. However, most of the extant
literature has focused on FINTECH innovation or the litigation of financial patents, while
few studies have explored the effects of FINTECH patents in the financial industry.
Therefore, this paper employs machine learning algorithms for classification and
association rule purposes in order to analyze the relationship between FINTECH patents and
performance from 2008 to 2016. Our results show that FINTECH patents can indeed improve
the profitability of the financial industry.

With the popularity of financial technology (FINTECH) chatbots equipped with artificial
intelligence, understanding the user's response mechanism can help bankers formulate
precise marketing strategies, which is a crucial issue in the social science field. To
fill these literature gaps, latent growth curve modeling was adopted by the present
research to survey taiwanese users of FINTECH chatbots. The present study proposed a
customer continuance model to predict continuance intention for FINTECH chatbots and that
cognitive and emotional dimensions positively influence the growth in a user's attitude
toward FINTECH chatbots, which in turn, positively influences continuance intention over
time. In total, 401 customers of FINTECH chatbots were surveyed through three time points
to examine the relationship between these variables over six months. The results support
the theoretical model of this research and can advance the literature of FINTECH chatbots

FINTECH, the merging of finance and modern internet-based technology, has rapidly
presented itself as a disruptor to traditional business financing, notably in the form of
crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending. In this article, we examine the determinants of the
use of FINTECH finance by businesses, with a particular focus on the ownership,
governance, and business practices that may modify the relationships with conventional
motivations for external finance. Using a comprehensive sample of chinese hi-tech small
and medium-sized enterprises (smes), we find that state-owned enterprises (soes) and
family firms and financially constrained firms are respectively much less and much more
likely to seek FINTECH finance. The quality of traditional relationship banking also
affects the relative desirability of FINTECH financing. As for family firms, we find that
innovation, as exemplified by r&d activity, effectively overrides any conventional
reluctance to access external finance, suggesting the relative benefits of FINTECH finance
for innovative high-growth firms.

This study analyses the diffusion of financial technology (FINTECH) and its interaction
with financial inclusion and living standards (gdp per capita). We consider the
determinants and effects of technology diffusion in financial services and identify two
possible transmission mechanisms from the financial sector to gdp per capitaa FINTECH
diffusion channel and a financial inclusion channel. Our empirical analysis focuses on the
diffusion of two enabling FINTECH innovations: atms and associated digital networks. The
relationships between FINTECH diffusion, financial inclusion and gdp per capita are
estimated using a panel data set for up to 137 countries over the period 19912015 using
both cross section and panel techniques, including an error correction model that
distinguishes short- and long-run effects. A key finding is that FINTECH diffusion and

average younger, better educated, have higher income and savings levels, pay less interest
and have better credit history than traditional bank borrowers. Furthermore, FINTECH
borrowers are less likely to default. Superior performance of FINTECH loans is driven by

The integration of the financial industry and financial technology (FINTECH) plays a
pivotal role in increasing financial services reach and inclusion for the large unbanked
population in indonesia. FINTECH adoption optimization expands the financial access to
formal financial institutions, especially to vulnerable groups such as the unbanked
population who predominantly reside in rural areas far from formal financial institutions.
FINTECH is viewed as a game changer to bring finance to the unreached communities via
information technology and digital financial landscape. In this causal research, data
collection was done via online questionnaires to 485 FINTECH users between december 2020
and april 2021. Result shows user innovativeness as a significant predictor, directly and
indirectly affecting the adoption of FINTECH in indonesia, while user attitude found the
most important factor towards FINTECH adoption. Financial literacy is the least important
variable to predict FINTECH adoption, contrary to popular belief. This indicates that
FINTECH usage requires less financial literacy and is potential to reach unbanked
population and those with low financial literacy. To make FINTECH more inclusive, the
government needs to accelerate improving information and communications technology (ict)
infrastructure such as widening mobile broadband penetration and soft infrastructure by
encouraging FINTECH startup, allowing regulatory sandbox for startups, and driving
financial institutions to innovate through FINTECH to bring financial services to unbanked

show that the digital economy can promote FINTECH development and that this development
level will increase by 12.4117 standard deviations each time the development level of the

The purpose of this paper is to explore determinants of the debt financing of FINTECH
start-ups. Using a new hand-collected multisource database that maps FINTECH start-ups
incorporated in the uk from 2010 to 2015, this study examines how the characteristics of
FINTECH start-ups affect the types of financing used in the first three years after
incorporation. The novelty of this study consists in the identification and analysis of
the determinants that enable FINTECH start-ups to obtain long-term debt and hence to
finance their growth. This paper contributes to the literature since we still have limited
understanding of the financing of FINTECH firms, even if academic literature examining the
financing of start-ups has expanded in the last few years. The results from the empirical
analysis demonstrate that unregulated FINTECH start-ups are more likely to be financed
with long-term debt. Asset structure, owner characteristics and the specific FINTECH
activity influence the funding source. Moreover, FINTECH start-ups backed by equity
investors receive less long-term debt funding than their peers. A better understanding of
the debt financing of FINTECH start-ups provides managers with valuable insights into ways
of managing their firms. The study is limited to a sample of FINTECH start-ups
incorporated in an advanced economy, and thus the generalization of the presented results
to developing economies will require caution.

Design/methodology/approach: this study uses an aggregate dataset of 73 countries from

performance. For robustness tests, the authors introduce different proxies of FINTECH
credit, perform sub-sample analysis and substitute control variables, as well as conduct
their empirical strategy to tackle potential endogeneity issue. First, the authors
evidence implies that FINTECH credit tends to reduce bank profitability, while improving
bank risk-related performance. This suggests that as FINTECH grows, it competes with banks
and takes some share of profits, but it also benefits banks in terms of stability. Third,
the authors argue that the impact of FINTECH credit on bank performance may depend on the
degree of banking regulation, and find that FINTECH credit would impose a more positive
influence on bank stability as more stringent banking regulation is present.
Originality/value: this study is the first to investigate whether FINTECH credit
influences bank performance, considering the moderating impact of bank regulations. The
findings imply that FINTECH credit tends to be more beneficial when bank regulations

the biggest market in the world, with $17.9bn worth of transactions in 2020 while iran is
at $9.2bn, uae $3.7bn, malaysia $3.0bn and indonesia $2.9bn. This condition was due to
various challenges in the islamic FINTECH industry in indonesia, including inadequate

FINTECH adoption index, expressed as a percentage of the digitally active population, for
27 countries of the world in 2019 reached the level of 64%. Millennials are the generation
which, compared to others, is characterized by the highest level of FINTECH adoptions. In
poland, in 2019, about 75% of the millennials used the services of FINTECH. This paper
aims to analyse and evaluate the selected determinants of using the innovative FINTECH
services by millennials in poland. To investigate how users adopt FINTECH services, we
have applied our own set of determinants  selected from an extensive literature review
covering both demographic, economic and behavioural characteristics. To analyse and
evaluate the impact of selected determinants of FINTECH adoption, a logistic regression
model was used. Millennials most open to innovative FINTECH services in poland are young
men with high and very high net income and not driven by low costs of financial services.

Purpose: FINTECH is having a profound impact in sub-saharan africa (ssa) because it offers
more financial inclusion. In this paper, the authors examine the interrelationship of
FINTECH, base of the pyramid (bop) entrepreneurs and social value creation, particularly
in the ssa context. The authors interviewed respondents from the sierra leone FINTECH
association and four bop entrepreneurs operating in different sectors. Findings: the
authors find that FINTECH services, specifically mobile money, play a significant role in
reducing uncertainty surrounding business operations. FINTECH also offers growth
possibilities for bop entrepreneurs and creates social value by providing transactional
security, convenience and reducing physical cash robberies. At the same time, FINTECH
contributes to social value by enhancing bop entrepreneurs as well as consumers' skills
development. Research limitations/implications: this study highlights the importance of
context-specific theorization when analyzing the interlinkage between bop
entrepreneurship, social value creation and FINTECH. For example, the possibility of
safety from a street robbery may not appear to be part of social value creation by a
technological development like FINTECH. Hence, scholars need to incorporate contextual
elements of risk, uncertainty and volatility while theorizing on FINTECH's application in
bop contexts. FINTECH offers entrepreneurs the possibility to be in regular contact with
customers and evaluate their purchasing patterns as well as emergent needs. FINTECH offers
bop entrepreneurs a possibility to further develop their technological skills as learning
to use such apps can be used as a basis for further skills development. From a policy
perspective, our study highlights the importance of regulating FINTECH charges so that the
affordability is increased, which is expected to result in significantly more bop
entrepreneurs using these services. Social implications: the authors find that at the same
time, FINTECH contributes to social value by enhancing skills development of bop consumers
who interact with case firms. Originality/value: this paper is one of the first studies
that specifically focuses on bop entrepreneurship and social value creation by FINTECH
services in an ssa context. It is also one of the few studies that incorporates views from
both entrepreneurs and the country's FINTECH association, rather than focusing solely on
either entrepreneurs or FINTECH firms.

Purpose: this paper aims to provide a review of literature directions regarding the
potential impact of FINTECH operators on the financial services market globally. This
paper reviews the literature to identify possible benefits or challenges that FINTECH
firms can have for the traditional banking system. Design/methodology/approach: this paper
is based on a review of published research papers related to FINTECH and digital finance.
The final sample included impactful papers about the effect of FINTECH activities on the
banking and financial services industry. Findings: the current paper indicated that while
FINTECH firms would take some market share away from banks, it is not expected that
FINTECH firms would substitute banks. However, banks are required to accelerate their
adoption of innovations and advanced technology to compete with FINTECH firms. It is also
proposed that strategic partnerships and cooperation could happen between banks and
FINTECH companies in a way that benefits both sides. Originality/value: the present paper
adds to the understanding of the effect of the FINTECH firms growth on the banking
industry in light of the emerging opportunities and threats for the financial sector. The
paper also provides guidance for fruitful research on the impact of FINTECH activities on
social and economic welfare in the future.

enough to appeal to heterogeneous customers needs and problems. This chapter analyzes the
antecedents to consumers differences and advances a managerial framework not only to
identify different consumers segments, but also to target relevant segments and position
the FINTECH value proposition through targeted market strategies that attract, retain, and
develop customers.

This chapter introduces FINTECH as an ecosystem that exists at the intersection of
entrepreneurship, finance, and technology. As a new industry that started as a consequence
of the financial crisis in 2008, FINTECH started by addressing unattended market segments
to encroach the financial industry. While the financial industry is still dominated by big
corporations and as FINTECH small companies started to grow, the competitive dynamics has
changed to reflect issues of competition and collaboration. While many technologies
amenable to FINTECH entrepreneurs abound, more relevant is how these technologies deliver
value to financial consumers. Actors in the FINTECH ecosystem go beyond the traditional
supplierconsumer relationship and a new full line of FINTECH products is available.

Whether the FINTECH can be considered an incremental or radical innovation, the
implications are clear in that a complete industry has mutated after the financial crisis

beyond the business realm, this chapter analyzes the impact of the FINTECH ecosystem on
societal issues.

With american families living on the financial edge and seeking out high-cost loans even
before covid-19, the term financial technology or FINTECH has been used like an
incantation aimed at remedying everything thats wrong with americas financial system.
FINTECH companies rent out and profit from the special legal status of these bank
partners, which in turn keeps the banks involvement in the shadows. Stripping down
predatory FINTECHs practices and showing them for what they really are, this article
situates FINTECH in the context of this countrys longstanding dual banking wars, both
between states and the federal government and between consumer advocates and banking
regulators. As the current pandemic wipes out wages and decimates savings, leaving
desperate families turning to predatory FINTECH finance ever more, the need for reform has

future. While this prospective technique is useful to foresee long-term changes, the
heterogeneous social and technical features of FINTECH require a broader framework to
encompass all participants, processes and routines, technological devices, and their
complex web of interrelationships to provide managers with a broad picture on how all
these components interact in layers of diffuse borders and cross-border flows of
knowledge. Drawing on the theory of assemblage, a prospective framework is advanced and
applied to FINTECH to gain insights on long-term changes.

forefront of the expansion of digital financial services. As such, the country has become
an important case for better understanding how FINTECH operates and what its expansion
entails for socioeconomic development. Against the backdrop of decades of generally
unsuccessful attempts to expand financial coverage in rural areas by conventional bricks-

of technological development in general, as well as in FINTECH, specifically targeting
their efforts towards the restoration of the environment. Therefore, this study attempts
to address the question of whether the FINTECH development is helping economies towards a
smooth transition towards a lower level of carbon and greenhouse gasses emissions. Our
results in this aspect are highly encouraging, and confirm that FINTECH development can in
fact help to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions, after the inclusion of appropriate
control variables. Moreover, these results are robust even after the incorporation of the
potential endogeneity of FINTECH development, by the usage of 2sls and gmm estimations.

Cooperatives are understood as legal entities that are established based on the principle
of kinship and also adheres to the principles of social economy with the aim to improve
their members in carrying out dominant transactions using cash, then modelled for the
future will rely on cashless and FINTECH virtual accounts. So that a new model is formed
in the movement of business intelligence that is FINTECH-based cooperative society that is
able to increase the movement of cooperative society, reduce the operational costs of
cooperative society and prosper the community with one mobile device.

Adopting the use of FINTECH technologies implies, in addition to a reduction in costs
derived from physical entities, an improvement in user satisfaction, greater flexibility
in terms of data access on different devices and more transparency in financial
management.
