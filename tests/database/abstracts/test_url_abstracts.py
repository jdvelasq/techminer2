    consequently , when trained on SUCH_UNBALANCED_DATASETS , ALL_MACHINE_LEARNING_CLASSIFIERS
    tend to produce HIGH_FALSE_POSITIVE_RATES . we propose TWO_METHODS for DATA_BALANCING . to
    oversample THE_MINORITY_CLASS , we proposed AN_INNOVATIVE_GAN called CHAOTICGAN , where we
    employed CHAOTIC_NOISE as INPUT for THE_GENERATOR . we also employed THE_TRADITIONAL_GAN (

    background : ACUTE_KIDNEY_INJURY ( AKI ) develops in 4 % of HOSPITALIZED_PATIENTS and is
    A_MARKER of CLINICAL_DETERIORATION and NEPHROTOXICITY . AKI_ONSET is highly variable in
    HOSPITALS , which makes it difficult to TIME_BIOMARKER_ASSESSMENT in ALL_PATIENTS for
    PREEMPTIVE_CARE . objective : the study sought to apply MACHINE_LEARNING_TECHNIQUES to
    ELECTRONIC_HEALTH_RECORDS and predict HOSPITAL acquired AKI by a 48 HOUR_LEAD_TIME , with
    THE_AIM to create AN_AKI_SURVEILLANCE_ALGORITHM that_is deployable in REAL_TIME . methods
    : THE_DATA were sourced from 20,732 CASE_ADMISSIONS in 16,288 PATIENTS over 1 year in
    OUR_INSTITUTION . we enhanced THE_BIDIRECTIONAL_RECURRENT_NEURAL_NETWORK_MODEL with
    A_NOVEL_TIME_INVARIANT_AND_TIME_VARIANT_AGGREGATED_MODULE to capture
    IMPORTANT_CLINICAL_FEATURES temporal to AKI in EVERY_PATIENT . TIME_SERIES_FEATURES
    included LABORATORY_PARAMETERS that preceded a 48 HOUR_PREDICTION_WINDOW before AKI_ONSET
    . the latter ' scorresponding reference was the final in HOSPITAL_SERUM_CREATININE

    explaining STOCK_PREDICTIONS is generally A_DIFFICULT_TASK for
    TRADITIONAL_NON_GENERATIVE_DEEP_LEARNING_MODELS , where EXPLANATIONS are limited to
    visualizing THE_ATTENTION_WEIGHTS on IMPORTANT_TEXTS . today , LARGE_LANGUAGE_MODELS (
    LLMS ) present A_SOLUTION to THIS_PROBLEM , given THEIR_KNOWN_CAPABILITIES to generate
    HUMAN_READABLE_EXPLANATIONS for THEIR_DECISION_MAKING_PROCESS . however , THE_TASK of
    STOCK_PREDICTION remains challenging for LLMS , as it requires THE_ABILITY to weigh
    THE_VARYING_IMPACTS of CHAOTIC_SOCIAL_TEXTS on STOCK_PRICES . THE_PROBLEM gets
    progressively harder with THE_INTRODUCTION of THE_EXPLANATION_COMPONENT , which requires
    LLMS to_explain verbally why CERTAIN_FACTORS are more important than THE_OTHERS .
    on_the_other_hand , to FINE_TUNE_LLMS for SUCH_A_TASK , one would need
    EXPERT_ANNOTATED_SAMPLES of EXPLANATION for EVERY_STOCK_MOVEMENT in THE_TRAINING_SET ,
    which is expensive and impractical to scale . to tackle THESE_ISSUES , we propose our
    SUMMARIZE_EXPLAIN_PREDICT ( SEP ) framework , which utilizes
    A_VERBAL_SELF_REFLECTIVE_AGENT and PROXIMAL_POLICY_OPTIMIZATION ( PPO ) that allow A_LLM
    teach itself how to generate EXPLAINABLE_STOCK_PREDICTIONS , in A_FULLY_AUTONOMOUS_MANNER
    . THE_REFLECTIVE_AGENT learns how to_explain PAST_STOCK_MOVEMENTS through
    A_SELF_REASONING_PROCESS , while THE_PPO_TRAINER_TRAINS_THE_MODEL to generate
    THE_MOST_LIKELY_EXPLANATIONS given THE_INPUT_TEXTS at TEST_TIME . THE_TRAINING_SAMPLES for
    THE_PPO_TRAINER are also THE_RESPONSES generated during THE_REFLECTIVE_PROCESS , which
    eliminates THE_NEED for HUMAN_ANNOTATORS . using OUR_SEP_FRAMEWORK , we

    between PRE and POST_BOG daily TEST_COUNTS was observed in 5 tracts , 80 % ( n=4 ) of
    which had A_POSITIVE_SLOPE_CHANGE . A_POSITIVE_SLOPE_CHANGE implied A_SIGNIFICANT_INCREASE
    in DAILY_COVID 19 TEST_COUNTS 2 weeks after TARGETED_BOG compared to THE_TESTING_TREND
    observed 2 weeks before INTERVENTION . in AN_ADDITIONAL_ANALYSIS of the 30 CENSUS_TRACTS
    that did not receive TARGETED_BOG , SIGNIFICANT_SLOPE_CHANGES were observed in 10 tracts ,
    of which POSITIVE_SLOPE_CHANGES were only observed in 20 % ( n=2 ) . in_summary , we found
    that BOG_TARGETED_TRACTS had mostly POSITIVE_DAILY_COVID 19 TEST count SLOPE_CHANGES ,
    whereas UNTARGETED_TRACTS had mostly NEGATIVE_DAILY_COVID 19 TEST count SLOPE_CHANGES .

    background : GERIATRIC_DISEASES ( E.g. , CHRONIC_DISEASES and GERIATRIC_SYNDROMES ) may
    result in IMPAIRED_PHYSICAL_PERFORMANCE and A_DECLINE in the QUALITY_OF_LIFE . THE_RESULTS
    of PREVIOUS_STUDIES reported THE_POSITIVE_EFFECTS of COMPREHENSIVE_COMMUNITY based
    REHABILITATION ( CBR ) services on PHYSICAL_AND_SOCIAL_FUNCTIONING and PSYCHOSOCIAL
    wellbeing . however , to provide ADEQUATE_AND_PERSONALISED_REHABILITATION_SERVICES , it is
    essential to understand THE_NEEDS of THE_OLDER_ADULTS_POPULATION . there have been
    NO_STUDIES on THE_NEED for CBR in OLDER_ADULTS_POPULATIONS that consider
    THEIR_HETEROGENEITY . therefore , HIGH_QUALITY_STUDIES are required to recognise
    THE_HETEROGENEITY and LATENT_CLASSES of CBR_NEEDS in OLDER_ADULTS_POPULATION_GROUPS . this
    study aims to identify THE_HETEROGENEITY of THE_REHABILITATION_NEEDS of OLDER_ADULTS in
    THE_COMMUNITY and explore whether OLDER_ADULTS with SIMILAR_CHARACTERISTICS have
    SIMILAR_NEEDS through A_CROSS_SECTIONAL_SURVEY and LATENT_CLASS_ANALYSIS ( LCA ) to
    provide SUPPORT for PERSONALISED_REHABILITATION_SERVICES . methods : the study is
    structured into FOUR_PHASES . THE_FIRST_PHASE will focus on constructing
    A_COMPREHENSIVE_QUESTIONNAIRE to ASSESS_REHABILITATION_NEEDS . in THE_SECOND_PHASE ,
    A_PILOT_STUDY will be conducted to evaluate the RELIABILITY_AND_VALIDITY of
    THE_COMPLETED_QUESTIONNAIRE . THIS_STEP ensures THE_ROBUSTNESS of THE_INSTRUMENT for
    DATA_COLLECTION . THE_THIRD_PHASE will involve CROSS_SECTIONAL_SURVEYS using
    THE_FINALISED_QUESTIONNAIRES to collect THE_NECESSARY_DATA from THE_TARGETED_POPULATION .
    THE_FOURTH_PHASE will focus on conducting LCA to determine THE_CBR_NEEDS of
    THE_OLDER_ADULT_POPULATION . discussion : the results of this study will provide
    NOVEL_AND_CRITICAL_INFORMATION for A_BETTER_UNDERSTANDING of THE_REHABILITATION_NEEDS ,
    POTENTIAL_CATEGORIES , and INFLUENCING_FACTORS of OLDER_ADULTS in THE_COMMUNITY . the
    study will be conducted in GUIZHOU_PROVINCE in WESTERN_CHINA , where

    FINANCIAL_SENTIMENT_ANALYSIS is THE_TASK of evaluating and quantifying THE_EMOTIONS and
    OPINIONS expressed in FINANCIAL_NEWS , REPORTS , or SOCIAL_MEDIA to help INVESTORS and
    INSTITUTIONS make INFORMED_DECISIONS . FINANCIAL_INSTITUTIONS have been actively exploring
    THE_USE of LARGE_LANGUAGE_MODELS ( LLMS ) to ANALYSE_MARKET_SENTIMENT_SIGNALS for
    A_MORE_NUANCED_UNDERSTANDING of A_BROADER_CONTEXT . however , ISSUES such_as THE_SCALE of
    TRAINING_DATA , MODEL_COMPLEXITY , and THE_POTENTIAL for HUMAN_OVERSIGHT can introduce or
    even AMPLIFY_BIAS in THESE_SYSTEMS . REPRESENTATION_BIAS is A_COMMON_CHALLENGE for LLMS as
    TRAINING_DATA fail to properly represent THE_TARGET_GROUPS , hence CAUSES_HARMFUL_BIAS
    in_general purpose use . therefore , replacing CURRENT_SOLUTIONS with LLMS in
    FINANCIAL_ORGANISATIONS requires A_ROBUST_EVALUATION_METHODOLOGY to ENSURE_FAIRNESS . this
    paper investigates A_THREE_LEVEL_BIAS_EVALUATION_APPROACH that specifically focuses on
    REPRESENTATION_BIAS and presents A_BASELINE_EVALUATION of THE_FINBERT_MODEL . STEP 1 uses
    A_SYNTHETIC_DATASET that explicitly REVEALS_SOURCES of BIAS , structured as PROBABILITY
    and embedding BASED_EVALUATION_RECIPES . STEP 2 evaluates THE_MODEL against DATA released
    by ANOTHER_COUNTRY ( E . g . INDIAN_NEWS_DATASET ) to assess ITS_PERFORMANCE in RELATION
    to MORE_IMPLICIT_BIASES . STEP 3 examines INDIVIDUAL_PROBLEMATIC_SAMPLES using
    TOKEN_BASED_INTERPRETABILITY_METHODS ( E . g . INTEGRATED_GRADIENTS ) . this paper
    presents THE_APPLICATION of THIS_STRUCTURED_BIAS_EVALUATION_PROCESS and ITS_RESULTS on
