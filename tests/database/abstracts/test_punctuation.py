    vehicles in the power market , based on the cooperative game theory , the combined
    operation mode of wind turbine , thermal power unit and electric vehicle for electric
    vehicle charging and eliminating wind is designed . the optimal scheduling model under the
    three party alliance , two party alliance and non alliance mode is constructed with the
    goal of maximizing the profit of the alliance . the profit results of different operating
    modes are used as the basis for distribution , adopting shapley value , banzhaf value ,
    and solidarity value allocation strategy for three party alliance profit distribution ,
    and set the core theory and mdp indicators to determine the possibility of cooperation and
    the intensity of cooperation intention under each allocation strategy . the mixed integer
    programming technique and cplex optimization software are used to simulate the simulation
    . the results show that the three party joint model can promote the consumption and
    development of wind power , and the cooperation under the shapely value allocation
    strategy can be established . the cooperation intentions of all members of the alliance

    taiwan ' s energy transformation to change the power structure is a new energy policy for
    economic development , industrial upgrading and environmental preservation . this study
    investigates the possibility of evaluating the economic spillover effects and co2
    emissions to evaluate new energy policy objectives by investing in solar and wind power
    generation systems . the research results show that the short term solar investment in
    economic effects is superior to wind power generation , and the economic spillover
    increases the scale of co2 emissions . the main reason is that the high ratio of equipment
    for wind power generation comes from imports and reduces the spillover effect . observing
    the economic spillover effects of individual industries , solar investment has the largest
    increase in ' ' sewage treatment sector and resource recovery ' ' sectors , while wind

    with the recent introduction of wind power generation of various scales due to its promise
    as a green energy resource , effectively managing the risk of fluctuations in wind power
    generation revenues has become an important issue . against this background , this study
    introduces several weather derivatives based on wind speed and temperature as underlying
    assets and examines their effectiveness . in particular , we propose new standardized
    derivatives with higher order monomial payoff functions , such as ' ' wind speed cubic
    derivatives ' ' and ' ' wind speed and temperature cross derivatives . ' ' in contrast to
    the existing nonparametric derivatives , the minimum variance hedging problem to find the
    optimal contract amount of these standardized derivatives is reduced to estimating a
    linear regression . we also develop a market trading model to put the proposed
    standardized derivatives into practical use and clarify the real world implications of
    standardizing weather derivatives . furthermore , to make trading more efficient , we
    propose a ' ' product selection ' ' strategy utilizing the ' ' variable selection ' '
    approach of lasso regression . empirical analysis confirms hedging effectiveness
    comparable to existing nonparametric derivatives and reveals the effectiveness of the

    wind farm clusters can enhance their operational profitability while supporting grid
    frequency regulation by participating in frequency regulation markets through the leasing
    of energy storage . to achieve this , a game theoretic optimization bidding model is
    proposed for leasing energy storage of wind farm clusters , considering fre quency
    regulation performance indicator assessment . the model consists of two layers : the upper
    layer models the bidding process in the frequency regulation market with multiple
    participants , while the lower layer models a leader follower game between energy storage
    lessors and wind farm clusters regarding leasing price and capacity . in this game , the
    energy storage operator acts as the leader , setting the leasing price in response to the
    leasing plan of wind farm clusters , and the wind farm clusters , as the follower , adjust
    the leasing plan according to the price . addition ally , an evolutionary threshold public
    goods game model is embedded within the wind farm clusters to address the cooperation
    dilemma caused by selfish behavior among individual members . by united solution of the
    model , the bidding strategy for leasing energy storage capacity and participating in the
    frequency regulation market is obtained . the case study results demonstrate that the
    proposed strategy effectively resolves the cooperation dilemma and en hances the overall
    profitability of the wind farm clusters . 2024 editorial department of zhejiang electric

    WIND_FARM_CLUSTERS can enhance THEIR_OPERATIONAL_PROFITABILITY while supporting
    GRID_FREQUENCY_REGULATION by participating in FREQUENCY_REGULATION_MARKETS through
    THE_LEASING of ENERGY_STORAGE . to achieve this ,
    A_GAME_THEORETIC_OPTIMIZATION_BIDDING_MODEL is proposed for LEASING_ENERGY_STORAGE of
    WIND_FARM_CLUSTERS , considering FRE_QUENCY_REGULATION_PERFORMANCE_INDICATOR_ASSESSMENT .
    THE_MODEL consists of TWO_LAYERS : the UPPER_LAYER_MODELS THE_BIDDING_PROCESS in
    THE_FREQUENCY_REGULATION_MARKET with MULTIPLE_PARTICIPANTS , while the lower LAYER_MODELS
    A_LEADER_FOLLOWER_GAME between ENERGY_STORAGE_LESSORS and WIND_FARM_CLUSTERS regarding
    LEASING_PRICE and CAPACITY . in THIS_GAME , THE_ENERGY_STORAGE_OPERATOR acts as THE_LEADER
    , setting THE_LEASING_PRICE in response to THE_LEASING_PLAN of WIND_FARM_CLUSTERS , and
    THE_WIND_FARM_CLUSTERS , as THE_FOLLOWER , adjust THE_LEASING_PLAN according to THE_PRICE
    . ADDITION_ALLY , AN_EVOLUTIONARY_THRESHOLD_PUBLIC_GOODS_GAME_MODEL is embedded within
    THE_WIND_FARM_CLUSTERS to address THE_COOPERATION_DILEMMA caused by SELFISH_BEHAVIOR among
    INDIVIDUAL_MEMBERS . by UNITED_SOLUTION of THE_MODEL , THE_BIDDING_STRATEGY for
    LEASING_ENERGY_STORAGE_CAPACITY and participating in THE_FREQUENCY_REGULATION_MARKET is
    obtained . THE_CASE_STUDY_RESULTS demonstrate that THE_PROPOSED_STRATEGY effectively
    resolves THE_COOPERATION_DILEMMA and EN_HANCES THE_OVERALL_PROFITABILITY of
    THE_WIND_FARM_CLUSTERS . 2024 editorial department of zhejiang electric power . all rights
