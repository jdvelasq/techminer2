--- Main ---

- ExactMatch (words-based): 
    Detects exact string equality (after minimal normalization such as trimming).
    Used as a baseline and for sanity checks.
    Case-senstive or insensitive based on configuration.

- FuzzyCutoffMatch (words-based): 
    Detects near-duplicate strings using surface-form fuzzy similarity with a cutoff threshold.
    Produces candidate pairs only, never merges.
    Scope: Keywords, noun phrases, organizations, sources (very conservative), authors (high cutoff).
    Case-insensitive.

- StemMatch (words-based):
    Finds words sharing the same root (Singular/Plural identification). It uses NLP lemmatization / stemming.
    Compare words in the same order.
    Case-insensitive.

- SignatureMatch (words-based):
    Detects equivalence by comparing normalized string signatures (fingerprints).
    Typical signature steps:
        lowercase
        remove punctuation
        tokenize
        optional stemming
        sort tokens
    Case-insensitive.

--- Selectors ----

- PrefixMatch (string-based): 
    Scans for terms starting with a specific string and proposes merging them into a standardized Key.
    Case-insensitive.

- SuffixMatch (string-based): 
    Scans for terms ending with a specific string (often to strip it).
    Case-insensitive.

- ContainsMatch (string-based): 
    Present strings that contain a specific pattern or substring
    Case-insensitive.

- EditDistanceMatch (string-based): 
    Present strings within a specified edit distance (Levenshtein distance)
    Case-insensitive.

- FindCloseMatch (string-based): 
    Present strings similar to a user-selected string within cutoff threshold
    Case-insensitive.

- RegexMatch (string-based): 
    Present strings matching a regular expression pattern
    Case-sensitive or insensitive based on regex flags.

- SubsetMatch (words-based): 
    Finds terms where one is a strict subset of the words in another.
    Case-insensitive.

--- Secundary ---

- HyphenationMatch (words-based): 
    Detects variants caused by hyphenation and spacing differences.
    Reduces fuzzy noise and catches high-confidence variants early.
    Case-insensitive.

- CaseVariationMatch (words-based): 
    Present strings that differ only in capitalization
    Case-sensitive.

- PunctuationVariationMatch (words-based): 
    Present strings that differ only in punctuation.
    Case-insensitive.

- AbbreviationMatch (words-based): 
    Detects acronym ↔ long-form relationships using first-letter logic and token alignment.
    Explicitly used by ClusterSuite (Acronym Identifier) and essential for keyword cleanup.
    Case-senstive or insensitive based on configuration.

- WordOrderMatch (words-based): 
    Detects strings composed of the same tokens in different orders.
    Case-insensitive.

- PluralSingularMatch (words-based):
    Present strings that differ only by pluralization.
    Case-insensitive.

- NumericVariationMatch (string-based): 
    Present strings with numeric variations (e.g., "test1" vs "test2")
