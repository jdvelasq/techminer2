# Comparison of tm2+ with bibliometrix

This is a comparison of "t"m2+: A Python Library for Tech-Mining, Bibliometrics and Science Mapping" with Bibliometrix, based on the most recent (March, 2026) of Bibliometrics

### Interface

Bibliometrix can be used in the command line, or using the Biblioshiny GUI.

tm2+ implements a system of final user-faced classes that are similar to GUIs and wizards in many well-known sofware. In this way, all information for a specific result is stored in a Python file. This is an example:

    >>> from tm2p import Field, ItemOrderBy
    >>> from tm2p.discover.cross_occurrence import Matrix
    >>> df = (
    ...     Matrix()
    ...     #
    ...     # COLUMNS:
    ...     .with_column_field(Field.AUTHKW_TOK)
    ...     .having_column_items_in_top(10)
    ...     .having_column_items_ordered_by(ItemOrderBy.OCC)
    ...     .having_column_item_occurrences_between(None, None)
    ...     .having_column_item_citations_between(None, None)
    ...     .having_column_items_in(None)
    ...     #
    ...     # ROWS:
    ...     .with_index_field(Field.AUTH_NORM)
    ...     .having_index_items_in_top(None)
    ...     .having_index_items_ordered_by(ItemOrderBy.OCC)
    ...     .having_index_item_occurrences_between(2, None)
    ...     .having_index_item_citations_between(None, None)
    ...     .having_index_items_in(None)
    ...     #
    ...     # COUNTERS:
    ...     .using_counters(True)
    ...     #
    ...     # DATABASE:
    ...     .where_root_directory("tests/fintech/")
    ...     .where_record_years_range(None, None)
    ...     .where_record_citations_range(None, None)
    ...     .where_records_match(None)
    ...     #
    ...     .run()
    ... )


### Fields for analysis

Bibliometrix uses the following fields for analysis.

- Authors
- Organizations
- Countries
- Sources
- References
- Country of first author
- Organization of first author
- Author Keywords
- Index Keywords
- Keywords

tm2+ extends the set adding:

- Keywords + noun phrases ----> Concepts
- Keywords + words


###  SEARCH / Data / Import or Load 

Bibliometrix allows the user to ingest data from:

* Web of Science
* Scopus
* OpenAlex
* Dimensions
* Lens
* PubMed (.txt format)
* Cochrane (.txt format)


The current version of tm2+ only ingest data from Scopus. For this case, tm2+ uses two primary sources of data: the main database downloaded, and the database of references of the database. This feature allows tm2+ to match references in free-format text with Scopus records. With this input tm2+ is able to transform free-format reference text in a format similar to WoS.


### SEARCH / Data / API

* OpenAlex
* PubMed

Not implemented in tm2+.


### SEARCH / Data / Merge Collections    

Bibliometrix allows the user to merge collections in Excel or R format comming from different DBs.

Not implemented in tm2+.


### SEARCH / Data / Reference Matching

This Bibliometrix tool helps identify and merge duplicate citations in your bibliographic dataset. It uses similarity algorithms to find variants of the same reference, allowing you to clean and standarize your data for more accurate analysis. 

Bibiometrix implements the following distance methods (with similarity threshold between 0.7 and 0.96):

* Jaro-Winkler
* Optimal String Alignment
* Longest Common Subsequence

Bibliometrix allows manual merging of references.

In tm2+, the normalization of cited references follows a procedure conceptually similar to the one implemented in Bibliometrix, but adapted to operate directly on free-text reference strings extracted from Scopus records. After merging the main dataset with the references dataset and applying aggressive text normalization (case folding, accent removal, punctuation stripping), candidate matches are generated using a sequence of approximate filters: (i) year proximit allowing ±1 year, (ii) author similarity based on the Jaro–Winkler metric applied to the first author surname, and (iii) title evidence measured through a high token-recall threshold** over the normalized title words. References passing these filters are grouped under the corresponding record identifier to create a global cited reference thesaurus, which is then used to standardize the cited references field across the corpus. This implementation provides an automated alternative to the manual merging strategy used in Bibliometrix while maintaining robust approximate matching for noisy reference strings. The user can modify and apply this thesaurus to the dataset to modify the references. tm2+ implements a thesaurus system similar to VantagePoint, such that techniques as fuzzy-cutoff matching can be applied to review the thesaurus.


### APPRAISAL / Filters

Bibliometrix implements a complex sequence of filters for selecting records. Biblioshiny uses the following filter options:

* Document type
* Lnaguage
* Publication year
* Subject category (1 or more selected items)
* Journal list
* Bradford law zones
* Region 
* Country
* Global citation range
* Glonal citation per year range

In tm2+, filters are applied per class. This is an example:

    >>> from tm2p.discover.overview import MainInformation
    >>> df = (
    ...     MainInformation()
    ...     #
    ...     # DATABASE:
    ...     .where_root_directory("tests/fintech/")
    ...     .where_record_years_range(None, None)
    ...     .where_record_citations_range(None, None)
    ...     .where_records_match(None)
    ...     #
    ...     .run()
    ... )

the methods `where_record_years_range`, `where_record_citations_range`, and `where_records_match` can generate complex filters to select records. Particularly, the last function `where_records_match` receives a python dictionary where the keys are the fields (in a similar way to biblioshiny), and each value is a list of strings with valid values. Records are selected when they match an value in any of the fields sepcified in `where_records_match`.


### ANALYSIS / Overview / Main information

tm2+ generates a pandas dataframe with an similar output to Biblioshiny's main information. This is an example:

### ANALYSIS / Overview / Anual scientific production & Average citations per year

tm2+ implements a function to plot several metrics per year, including the number of documents, and the average citations per year.


### ANALYSIS / Overview / Life cycle

Bibliometrix presents a Life Cycle of Scientific Production module that implements a logistic growt model to analyze the temporal dynamics of research topics. This approach, grounded in the theory of scientific paradigms and innovation diffusion, allows researchers to identify the current development stage of a field, predicting future trends, and estimate when a topic reach maturity or saturation. By fitting a logistic curveto the annual publication counts in the data collection, this analysis reveals whether a research are is in its emergence phase, rapid growth phase, maturity phase or decline phase.

Not implemented in tm2+.


### ANALYSIS / Overview / Three-field plot

Bibliometrix implements a three-field plot advanced visualization tool that reveals the relationships among three distinct bibliographic dimensions through an iterative Sankey diagram.

In tm2+, the Sankey plot is implemented for a variable number of fields, not only 3.


### ANALYSIS / Sources / Most relevant sources & Most local cited sources

Bibliometrix presents a table and a diagram with the sources ordened by the number of documents. Also, Bibliometrix presents a table and a diagram with the most local cited sources (in the references) ordened by the number of documents.

tm2+ implements a Metrics class to compute several indicators as is showed in this example:

    >>> from tm2p.analyze.metrics import Metrics
    >>> df = (
    ...     Metrics()
    ...     #
    ...     # FIELD:
    ...     .with_source_field(Field.AUTHKW_NORM)
    ...     .having_items_in_top(10)
    ...     .having_items_ordered_by(ItemOrderBy.OCC)
    ...     .having_item_occurrences_between(None, None)
    ...     .having_item_citations_between(None, None)
    ...     .having_items_in(None)
    ...     #
    ...     # DATABASE:
    ...     .where_root_directory("tests/fintech/")
    ...     .where_record_years_range(None, None)
    ...     .where_record_citations_range(None, None)
    ...     #
    ...     .run()
    ... )
    >>> type(df).__name__
    'DataFrame'
    >>> df.shape[0] > 1
    True
    >>> df.shape[1] > 1

    financial services             10  ...       financial services 007:01673
    <BLANKLINE>
    [10 rows x 17 columns]
    >>> from pprint import pprint
    >>> pprint(df.columns.tolist())
