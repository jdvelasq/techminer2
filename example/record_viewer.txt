   further , it is significantly discouraging to perceive that only 10 of the
   209 RESPONDENTS had ever used FINTECH_SERVICES , representing under 1 per

   implications : this study was conducted in GERMANY and might have produced

   furthermore , RESPONDENTS may have been influenced by PAST_EXPERIENCES about

AB TRANSFORMATION of AGRIBUSINESS is critical in_light_of THE_AGENDA for

   ( GREEN ) technologies as_well_as with DIGITIZED_AGRICULTURE plays
   AN_IMPORTANT_ROLE when it comes to , for_example , sdg 12 , specifically ,
   RESPONSIBLE_PRODUCTION , as it can MITIGATE_TRADE_OFFS and ENHANCE_SYNERGIES

   INCREASING_PROFITABILITY without ADDITIONAL_USE of NATURAL_RESOURCES .
   IMPORTANT_LIMITATIONS and RISKS_NEED to be addressed , however , for

   in THIS_CONTEXT . MITIGATING_FACTORS include

AB purpose : this paper aims to EXPLORE_FINTECH and ITS_DYNAMIC_TRANSITIONS in
   THE_BANKING_INDUSTRY . in_particular , the study analyses
   THE_SYSTEMIC_INNOVATION_NATURE of FINTECH_BASED_INNOVATIONS . the main
   contribution of this research study is THE_DEVELOPMENT of
   SYSTEMIC_INNOVATION_MODEL which can be used as A_DYNAMIC_TOOL to track
   THE_PROGRESS and PATTERN of TECHNOLOGY_DEVELOPMENT and DIFFUSION .
   THE_RESEARCH also discusses THE_LATEST_FINANCIAL_INNOVATION of

   DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/approach : this research uses THE_CASE_STUDY_APPROACH to
   ANALYSE_THE_SYSTEMIC_INNOVATION_CHARACTERISTICS of FINTECH_BASED_INNOVATIONS
   . this research offers A_NEW_SYSTEMIC_INNOVATION_MODEL which is developed
   and can be used as A_DYNAMIC_TOOL to track THE_PROGRESS and PATTERN of
   TECHNOLOGY_DEVELOPMENT and DIFFUSION . the study uses
   FINTECH_BASED_INNOVATIONS as CASE_STUDY_SAMPLES to gain
   A_BETTER_UNDERSTANDING concerning THE_SYSTEMIC_CHARACTERISTICS and
   THE_PATTERN of TECHNOLOGY_DIFFUSION under THE_ANALYTICAL_FRAMEWORK of
   SYSTEMIC_INNOVATION_MODEL . this research involves QUALITATIVE_INTERVIEWS
   with FIVE_MAJOR_COMMERCIAL_BANKS in THE_FINANCIAL_SERVICES_INDUSTRY of
   THAILAND . findings : THE_ANALYSES of FINDINGS show
   THE_SYSTEMIC_CHARACTERISTICS of FINTECH_BASED_INNOVATIONS in
   THE_BANKING_INDUSTRY , both at A_GLOBAL_SCALE and THAILAND_CASE .
   THE_ANALYSES have shown THAT_SYSTEMIC_CHARACTERISTICS of
   THE_INNOVATION_PROCESS are THE_OUTCOME of INTERACTIONS between
   THE_COMPLEXITY of THE_INNOVATION and THE_CAPABILITIES of INNOVATORS in
   managing THE_INNOVATION . THE_INSIGHTFUL_IMPLICATIONS on THE_SYSTEMIC_NATURE
   of INNOVATION give THE_TREND and DIRECTION of
   FINTECH_BASED_INNOVATION_DEVELOPMENT in THE_BANKING_INDUSTRY .
   ORIGINALITY/VALUE : THE_MAIN_CONTRIBUTION which SHOWS_ORIGINALITY and VALUE
   of THIS_PAPER is THE_DEVELOPMENT of SYSTEMIC_INNOVATION_MODEL .
   THIS_RESEARCH_STUDY develops A_SYSTEMIC_INNOVATION_MODEL to
   ANALYSE_THE_SYSTEMIC_CHARACTERISTICS which can be applied to ALL_INNOVATIONS
   in ANY_INDUSTRY . THE_MODEL can also help track THE_PROGRESS and PATTERN of
   TECHNOLOGY_DEVELOPMENT and DIFFUSION . therefore , THE_MODEL can be used to
   project THE_TREND and DIFFUSION_OF_INNOVATION_COMPETITION in
