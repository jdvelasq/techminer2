Techminer2: A package for the analysis of bibliographic datasets using Python
#########################################################################################

**TechMiner2** is a package for mining relevant information about topics related to Research and 
Development (R&D) literature extracted from bibliographical databases as Scopus. **TechMiner2**
facilitates studies of systematic mapping of literature and Tech mining studies. The package can 
be used by users with basic knowledge of Python programming. However, users with advanced 
knowledge in programming and text mining can easily incorporate their codes to maximize the power 
of the library and develop advanced analysis. The package can be used to:

* Realize analyzes based on document-by-term pattern, for example, number of documents by author, by source or by keyword. 

* Calculate and plot the number of documents or citations by year.

* Realize analyzes based on term-by-term pattern, for example, number of documents by keywords and by author, by keyword and by year and so on.

* Compute and plot co-ocurrence, correlation and autocorrelation matrices.

* Realize Principal Component Analysis to detect and analyze clusters of data.

* Plot heatmaps, networks and many other types of plots for analyzing data.

**TechMiner2** is an open source (distributed under the MIT license) and friendly-user
package developed and tested in Python version 3.6.
