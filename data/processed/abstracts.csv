2021-0042,0,"the implementation of financial technology (fintech) in the islamic finance industry has created a totally new phenomenon of banking and financial behaviour for the stakeholders, particularly in malaysia."
2021-0042,1,"as part of the financial revolution, the islamic finance sector ought to embrace fintech to diversify the services/products offered as the digitalisation process is taking place in the fourth industrial revolution era."
2021-0042,2,"in order to safeguard the assimilation of the technology into the existing traditional practice of islamic finance, shariah-compliant regulation is, therefore, necessary for governing the potential risks associated throughout the process of financial activities."
2021-0042,3,"hence, this paper intends to analyse the need for shariah-compliant regulation to govern fintech-related activity in the islamic finance industry."
2021-0042,4,the article emphasises the need from several aspects such as the non-comprehensiveness of the islamic financial services act (ifsa) 2013. the increasing rate of financial inclusion and.
2021-0042,5,the qualifications of the shariah advisory council's (sac) members in malaysia.
2021-0042,6,it also provides recommendations through the introduction of subsidiary legislation pursuant to ifsa.
2021-0042,7,production of regulatory sandbox framework especially for islamic fintech firms.
2021-0042,8,and emphasis on the importance of sac members possessing knowledge in technological aspect in order to ensure the need for shariah-compliant regulation in the islamic finance industry is properly satisfied.
2021-0043,0,the fintech innovation of e-money products in the financial sector has not gained sufficient recognition in nigeria's developing country.
2021-0043,1,"despite the numerous economic benefits associated with this innovation, physical cash for financial transactions is still prevalent."
2021-0043,2,banks are still experiencing some level of cash withdrawals and deposits by individuals who refuse to embrace modern technology.
2021-0043,3,this study stresses the economic benefits of e-payment channels available today and statistically supports evidence to substantiate their usefulness.
2021-0043,4,"in this study, we use banks' e-money products as the independent variables, while gdp is employed as a proxy for the economy."
2021-0043,5,the data are collected from 2006-2019 and are analyzed with multiple regression techniques using e-views version 9 software.
2021-0043,6,the result shows that all banks' e-money products have a significant favorable influence on the economy except the pos that is yet to gain momentum.
2021-0043,7,"the study suggests the full implementation of the cashless policy, proper education of the populace and guidelines to check electronic fraud."
2021-0044,0,this paper conducted a comprehensive analysis based on bibliometrics and science mapping analysis.
2021-0044,1,"first, 848 publications were obtained from web of science."
2021-0044,2,"their fundamental characteristics were analyzed, including the types, annual publications, hot research directions, and foci (by theme analysis, co-occurrence analysis, and timeline analysis of author keywords)."
2021-0044,3,"next, the prolific objects (at the level of countries/regions, institutions, journals, and authors) and corresponding pivotal cooperative relationship networks were used to highlight who pays attention to fintech."
2021-0044,4,"furthermore, the citation structures of authors and journals were investigated, including citation and co-citation."
2021-0044,5,"additionally, this paper presents the burst detection analysis of cited authors, journals, and references."
2021-0044,6,"finally, combining the analysis results with the current financial environment, the challenges and future development opportunities are discussed further."
2021-0044,7,"accordingly, a comprehensive study of the fintech documents not only reviews the current research characteristics and trajectories but also helps scholars find the appropriate research entry point and conduct in-depth research."
2021-0045,0,"organizations, such as the world health organization, encouraged consumers to use contactless payment methods instead of payment methods such as cash, which can be carriers of the sars-2 virus."
2021-0045,1,this study aims to evaluate factors that influence hungarian generation x's behavioral intentions to use mobile payment services during the pandemic.
2021-0045,2,we conducted an electronic questionnaire-based survey among 1120 generation x individuals.
2021-0045,3,"using structural equation modeling to analyze the study's conceptual model, our results confirm that perceived covid-19 risk, perceived usefulness, and subjective norms significantly influence hungarian generation x's behavioral intentions to use mobile payment services."
2021-0045,4,"moreover, perceived usefulness mediates the relationship between perceived ease of use and behavioral intention to use mobile payment systems."
2021-0045,5,"overall, our results show that the model of perceived covid-19 risk, perceived usefulness, subjective norms, and perceived ease of use explains 62.9% of the variance in intention to use mobile payment systems."
2021-0045,6,our study contributes to the technology acceptance model and highlights its effectiveness in explaining the behavioral intention to adopt mobile payments during the covid-19 pandemic.
2021-0025,0,"fintech, the merging of finance and modern internet-based technology, has rapidly presented itself as a disruptor to traditional business financing, notably in the form of crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending."
2021-0025,1,"in this article, we examine the determinants of the use of fintech finance by businesses, with a particular focus on the ownership, governance, and business practices that may modify the relationships with conventional motivations for external finance."
2021-0025,2,"using a comprehensive sample of chinese hi-tech small and medium-sized enterprises (smes), we find that state-owned enterprises (soes) and family firms and financially constrained firms are respectively much less and much more likely to seek fintech finance."
2021-0025,3,"in the chinese context, we argue that part of this may be because of the relative ease with which soe smes can access cheaper conventional finance through soe banks."
2021-0025,4,the quality of traditional relationship banking also affects the relative desirability of fintech financing.
2021-0025,5,"as for family firms, we find that innovation, as exemplified by r&d activity, effectively overrides any conventional reluctance to access external finance, suggesting the relative benefits of fintech finance for innovative high-growth firms."
2021-0046,0,"the manuscript text contains an error on page 13. the text should read as follows: with a potential 60 billion twd in spending annually, tourists from mainland china account for about 35% of annual tourists to taiwan."
2021-0046,1,"these banks are interested in both the mainland chinese tourists and in cross-border e-commerce transactions and cross-border tuition payments (there are about 8,000 mainland chinese students studying in taiwan)."
2021-0039,0,can peer-to-peer lending platforms mitigate fraudulent behaviors?
2021-0039,1,or have lending players been acting similar to free-riders?
2021-0039,2,this paper constructs a new proxy to investigate lending platform misconduct and compares the fico score and the lendingclub credit grade.
2021-0039,3,"to examine whether the lack of verification by the fintech platform affects lenders collection performance, i explore the recovery rate (rr) of non-performing loans through a mixed-continuous model."
2021-0039,4,the regression results show that the degree of prudence taken by the lending platform in the pre-screening activity negatively affects the detection of some misreporting borrowers.
2021-0039,5,"i also find that the fintech platforms missing verification information (e.g., annual income and employment length) affects the rr of non-performing loans, thereby hampering lenders collection performance."
2021-0047,0,"in recent years, biometric technologies have been widely embedded in mobile devices."
2021-0047,1,these technologies were originally employed to enhance the security of mobile devices.
2021-0047,2,"with the rise of financial technology (fintech), which uses mobile devices and applications as promotional platforms, biometrics has the important role of strengthening the identification of such applications for security."
2021-0047,3,"however, users still have privacy and trust concerns about biometrics."
2021-0047,4,previous studies have demonstrated that the technology acceptance model (tam) can rigorously explain and predict user acceptance of new technologies.
2021-0047,5,this study therefore modifies the tam as a basic research architecture.
2021-0047,6,"based on a literature review, we add two new variables, namely, perceived privacy and perceived trust, to extend the traditional tam to examine user acceptance of biometric identification in fintech applications."
2021-0047,7,"first, we apply the analytic hierarchy process (ahp) to evaluate the defined objects and relevant criteria of the research framework."
2021-0047,8,"second, we use the ahp results in the scenario analysis to explore biometric identification methods that correspond to objects and criteria."
2021-0047,9,the results indicate that face and voice recognition are the two most preferred identification methods in fintech applications.
2021-0047,10,"in addition, there are significant changes in the results of the perceived trust and perceived privacy dominant scenarios."
2021-0007,0,"this study examines the spillover effect between financial technology (fintech) stocks and other financial assets (gold, bitcoin, a global equity index, crude oil, and the us dollar) during the covid-19 crisis."
2021-0007,1,"employing daily data from june 2019 to august 2020, our empirical analysis shows that the outbreak of covid-19 exacerbated volatility transmission across asset classes, while subsequent decreases in new confirmed cases globally reduced the intensity of these spillovers."
2021-0007,2,"the evidence for the usd and gold supports their safe haven properties during catastrophic events, while innovative technology products as represented by a financial technology index (kftx) and bitcoin were highly susceptible to external shocks."
2021-0007,3,"these results show that when push comes to shove, the buck stops with the usd and gold and that the exorbitant privilege enjoyed by the usd prevailed during the covid-19 pandemic."
2021-0002,0,"financial technology (fintech) makes a significant contribution to the financial system by reducing costs, providing higher quality services and increasing customer satisfaction."
2021-0002,1,"hence, new studies play an essential role to improve fintech investments."
2021-0002,2,this study evaluates fintech-based investments of european banking services with an application of an original methodology that considers interval type-2 (it2) fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory and it2 fuzzy topsis models.
2021-0002,3,empirical findings are controlled for consistency by applying the vikor method.
2021-0002,4,"moreover, we conduct a sensitivity analysis by considering six distinct cases."
2021-0002,5,this study contributes to the existing literature by identifying the most important fintech-based investment alternatives to improve the financial performance of european banks.
2021-0002,6,"our empirical findings illustrate that results are coherent, reliable, and identify competitive advantage as the most important factor among fintech-based determinants."
2021-0002,7,"moreover, payment and money transferring systems are the most important fintech-based investment alternatives."
2021-0002,8,"it is recommended that, among fintech-based investments, european banks should mainly focus on payment and money transferring alternatives to attract the attention of customers and satisfy their expectations."
2021-0002,9,this is also believed to have a positive impact on the ease of bank receivable collection.
2021-0002,10,another important point is that fintech-based investments in money transferring systems could help to decrease costs.
2021-0034,0,this study aims to evaluate the crowdfunding alternatives regarding new service development process pathways of clean energy investment projects.
2021-0034,1,"in this framework, a new model has been generated by considering the consensus-based group decision-making with incomplete preferences, pythagorean fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (dematel) and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (topsis)."
2021-0034,2,"moreover, a comparative evaluation has been performed with vise kriterijumska optimizacija i. kompromisno resenje methodology and sensitivity analysis has been made by considering 4 different cases."
2021-0034,3,the main contribution is to identify appropriate crowdfunding-based funding alternatives for the improvement of the clean energy investments with a novel mcdm model.
2021-0034,4,"by considering the iteration technique and consensus-based analysis, the missing parts in the evaluations can be completed and opposite opinion problems can be reduced."
2021-0034,5,"furthermore, with the help of hybrid mcdm model by combining dematel and topsis, more objective results can be reached."
2021-0034,6,it is concluded that the analysis results are coherent and reliable.
2021-0034,7,the findings indicate that the full launch is the most significant criterion for equity and debt-based crowdfunding alternatives.
2021-0034,8,"on the other side, the analysis has the highest weight for reward and donation-based alternatives whereas design is the most essential item regarding the royalty-based alternative."
2021-0034,9,"additionally, it is also defined that equity-based crowdfunding alternative is the most significant for the service development process of clean energy investment projects."
2021-0034,10,"in this way, it will be possible to provide a continuous resource for clean energy investment projects."
2021-0034,11,"on the other hand, by providing financing with equity, there will be no fixed financing cost for clean energy investors."
2021-0034,12,"if these investors make a profit, they distribute dividends with the decision of their authorized bodies."
2021-0048,0,"the u.s. financial markets faced an unprecedented rapid decline and recovery on may 6, 2010, known as the may 6 flash crash."
2021-0048,1,roughly one trillion $ market value in less than thirty minutes vanished with the biggest one-day point decline in the history of the djia at the time.
2021-0048,2,"since the market events took place in electronic markets, and algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading, parts of fintech, played significant roles, we handle the may 6 flash crash from the fintech, suptech, and financial supervision perspectives."
2021-0048,3,"with the flashback method, we analyzed the reactions of market participants, media, and two financial supervisors, the sec, and the cftc, to the market crash."
2021-0048,4,"we find that the technological imbalance between financial markets or institutions and their supervisors drove the markets in uncertainty, hence in a fear and panic environment."
2021-0048,5,"since the imbalance has not diminished yet, the same risks still exist."
2021-0048,6,"as a remedy, we introduce a new concept and model with a well-functioning suptech system to cope with the may 6 type fintech crises."
2021-0049,0,fintech offers a new way to mobilize resources for all kinds of uses  including for funding sustainable development.
2021-0049,1,roughly 3%13% of funding required for the uns sustainable development goals (sdgs) or around $50 billion to $125 billion -- could come from a fintech dividend.
2021-0049,2,"such a dividend derives from the use of fintech platforms to increase savings and investment (overall), channel resources into publicly-funded as well as privately-funded sdg-related activities and policies, and encourage the use of internet platforms, which deliver novel goods and services that relate to the seventeen sdgs."
2021-0049,3,less than half of un members have fintech laws and policies  making fintech a ripe area for right-regulating.
2021-0049,4,"unfortunately, in areas like institutional reform  no amount of money can guarantee achieving the sdgs, without wider legal and administrative reforms."
2021-0049,5,and no clear data about the exact policies needed to help grow an economy (or pay for sdg spending) serve as any guide.
2021-0049,6,with total investment in fintech stuck at around $150 billion to $200 billion  the hoped for deluge of fintech dollars on sdg activities may remain a trickle for years to come.
2021-0050,0,the contemporary innovations in financial technology (fintech) serve society with an environmentally friendly atmosphere.
2021-0050,1,fintech covers an enormous range of activities from data security to financial service deliverables that enable the companies to automate their existing business structure and introduce innovative products and services.
2021-0050,2,"therefore, there is an increasing demand for scholars and professionals to identify the future trends and directions of the topic."
2021-0050,3,"this is why the present study conducted a bibliometric analysis in social, environmental, and computer sciences fields to analyse the implementation of environment-friendly computer applications to benefit societal growth and well-being."
2021-0050,4,we have used the bibliometrix 3.0 package of the r-program to analyse the core aspects of fintech systematically.
2021-0050,5,the study suggests that acm international conference proceedings is the core source of published fintech literature.
2021-0050,6,china leads in both multiple and single country production of fintech publications.
2021-0050,7,bina nusantara university is the most relevant affiliation.
2021-0050,8,arner and buckley provide impactful fintech literature.
2021-0050,9,"in the conceptual framework, we analyse relationships between different topics of fintech and address dynamic research streams and themes."
2021-0050,10,these research streams and themes highlight the future directions and core topics of fintech.
2021-0050,11,the study deploys a co-occurrence network to differentiate the entire fintech literature into three research streams.
2021-0050,12,"these research streams are related to cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, financial technology, financial industry stability, service, innovation, regulatory technology (regtech), and machine learning and deep learning innovations."
2021-0050,13,"the study deploys a thematic map to identify basic, emerging, dropping, isolated, and motor themes based on centrality and density."
2021-0050,14,"these various themes and streams are designed to lead the researchers, academicians, policymakers, and practitioners to narrow, distinctive, and significant topics."
2021-0051,0,fintech has been in the focus of discussion for quite some time.
2021-0051,1,"however, the market share of fintech companies is still relatively small compared to that of more traditional financial services."
2021-0051,2,"the purpose of this paper is to analyse the status quo, current developments, and challenges ahead for the latvian fintech sector."
2021-0051,3,"we combine three analyses: a political and legal, economic, social, and technological environment (pest) analysis."
2021-0051,4,a survey among fintech companies.
2021-0051,5,and an analysis of the size and financial performance of fintech companies during the last 10 years.
2021-0051,6,"we find that the current status of regulation is one of the main obstacles to fintech development, because it does not sufficiently consider fintech-specific aspects."
2021-0051,7,problems in attracting a skilled workforce and an environment that is not very supportive of new developments in finance are further challenges and might explain at least part of the growth and financial performance difficulties.
2021-0051,8,"a revision, modernization, and harmonization of regulation is essential to create a level playing field for all market participants: fintech companies, traditional financial service providers, and those originally traditional players that are integrating fintech solutions in their business model."
2021-0051,9,further efforts are also required to foster latvias attractiveness for a skilled workforce.
2021-0051,10,we hope that this study helps increase the visibility of latvian fintech and contributes to the development of the new latvian fintech strategy.
2021-0031,0,we study the personal credit market using unique individual-level data covering fintech and traditional lenders.
2021-0031,1,"we show that fintech lenders acquire market share by lending first to higher-risk borrowers and then to safer borrowers, and rely mainly on hard information to make credit decisions."
2021-0031,2,fintech borrowers are significantly more likely to default than neighbor individuals with the same characteristics borrowing from traditional financial institutions.
2021-0031,3,"furthermore, they tend to experience a short-lived reduction in the cost of credit, because their indebtedness increases more than non-fintech borrowers after loan origination."
2021-0031,4,"however, fintech lenders' pricing strategies are likely to take this into account."
2021-0016,0,prior research suggests that corporate boards and directors play important roles in firm strategy and performance.
2021-0016,1,"in this paper, we examine an important yet under-explored avenue and focus on their role in overcoming the multilevel psychic distance (pd) faced by internationalizing small and medium-sized enterprises (smes) originating from an emerging market."
2021-0016,2,"analysing indian fintech smes, using multiple case studies, our findings reveal that boards contribute important network-level resources and knowledge about foreign markets, which in turn assists internationalizing smes in mitigating pd."
2021-0016,3,"we demonstrate that the human and social capital of boards play important, yet distinctly different, roles in mitigating pd at pre- and post-internationalization phases."
2021-0016,4,"at the pre-internationalization phase, directors prior international and industry experience, as well as board interlocks and prior connections, are most valuable, whereas at the post-entry phase, transnational boards, and those with stronger trust-based personal relationships (i.e."
2021-0016,5,"greater depth of social capital, facilitate faster experiential learning."
2021-0016,6,"taken together, our findings contribute novel insights into the mechanisms through which boards affect the outcomes of firms operating, and originating from, extreme institutional environments."
2021-0016,7,"further, we draw implications for research and practice."
2021-0003,0,the increasing pervasiveness of technology-driven firms that offer financial services has led to growing pressure on traditional banks to modernize their core business activities and services.
2021-0003,1,many banks tackle the challenges of digitalization by cooperating with startup firms that offer technology-driven financial services and novel service packages (fintechs).
2021-0003,2,"in this article, we examine which banks typically collaborate with fintechs, how intensely they do so, and which form of alliance they prefer."
2021-0003,3,"using hand-collected data covering the largest banks from canada, france, germany, and the united kingdom, we provide detailed evidence on the different forms of alliances occurring in practice."
2021-0003,4,we show that banks are significantly more likely to form alliances with fintechs when they pursue a well-defined digital strategy and/or employ a chief digital officer.
2021-0003,5,"moreover, in line with incomplete contract theory, we find that banks more frequently invest in small fintechs but often build product-related collaborations with larger fintechs."
2021-0052,0,the integration of the financial industry and financial technology (fintech) plays a pivotal role in increasing financial services reach and inclusion for the large unbanked population in indonesia.
2021-0052,1,"fintech adoption optimization expands the financial access to formal financial institutions, especially to vulnerable groups such as the unbanked population who predominantly reside in rural areas far from formal financial institutions."
2021-0052,2,fintech is viewed as a game changer to bring finance to the unreached communities via information technology and digital financial landscape.
2021-0052,3,"in this causal research, data collection was done via online questionnaires to 485 fintech users between december 2020 and april 2021. data analysis and path modelling was performed using smartpls 3.0 software."
2021-0052,4,"result shows user innovativeness as a significant predictor, directly and indirectly affecting the adoption of fintech in indonesia, while user attitude found the most important factor towards fintech adoption."
2021-0052,5,"financial literacy is the least important variable to predict fintech adoption, contrary to popular belief."
2021-0052,6,this indicates that fintech usage requires less financial literacy and is potential to reach unbanked population and those with low financial literacy.
2021-0052,7,"to make fintech more inclusive, the government needs to accelerate improving information and communications technology (ict) infrastructure such as widening mobile broadband penetration and soft infrastructure by encouraging fintech startup, allowing regulatory sandbox for startups, and driving financial institutions to innovate through fintech to bring financial services to unbanked population."
2021-0053,0,"with transformative evolution involving crypto-assets, machine learning applications and data-driven finance models, complex regulatory and policy issues are emerging."
2021-0053,1,inadequate frameworks in fintech markets create regulatory friction and regulatory fragmentation.
2021-0053,2,these limitations continue to feature when piecemeal regulatory transition occurs.
2021-0053,3,the danger of eu member states being left behind in the fintech innovation race if the regulatory landscape is cumbersome or incomplete for new business models is real.
2021-0053,4,regulatory lag and regulatory friction also act as a disenabler for ease of cross-border fintech trade in the eu.
2021-0053,5,this article critically engages with the manner in which the regulatory sandbox has rapidly gained critical mass in member states as a valuable adaptive measure supporting a route to market for fintech entrepreneurs.
2021-0053,6,"against the backdrop of the european commissions digital finance strategy, the article further advances scholarship on fintech in the eu by probing the eus resulting regulatory dilemma, undertaking a systematic evaluation of the continuum of complex policy options available to the european union in response to the spreading regulatory sandbox phenomenon."
2021-0054,0,tech-leading organizations are embracing the forthcoming artificial intelligence revolution.
2021-0054,1,intelligent systems are replacing and cooperating with traditional software components.
2021-0054,2,"thus, the same development processes and standards in software engineering ought to be complied in artificial intelligence systems."
2021-0054,3,this study aims to understand the processes by which artificial intelligence-based systems are developed and how state-of-the-art lifecycle models fit the current needs of the industry.
2021-0054,4,"we conducted an exploratory case study at ing, a global bank with a strong european base."
2021-0054,5,we interviewed 17 people with different roles and from different departments within the organization.
2021-0054,6,"we have found that the following stages have been overlooked by previous lifecycle models: data collection, feasibility study, documentation, model monitoring, and model risk assessment."
2021-0054,7,our work shows that the real challenges of applying machine learning go much beyond sophisticated learning algorithms  more focus is needed on the entire lifecycle.
2021-0054,8,"in particular, regardless of the existing development tools for machine learning, we observe that they are still not meeting the particularities of this field."
2021-0055,0,this research attempt to analyze risk and benefit factors as well as their influence on sustainability intention of fintech.
2021-0055,1,we elucidate the planned behavior theory by including the perceived benefits and perceived risk variables to investigate its effect on intention to continue using fintech.
2021-0055,2,we also examined whether or not men and women are affected differently by the benefits and risk they perceive when using fintech.
2021-0055,3,"data were collected through online surveys, then being analyzed using gsca."
2021-0055,4,the results reveal perceived benefits are affected significantly by the convenience aspect and deliver a significant effect on fintech continuance intention.
2021-0055,5,the risk perceived by fintech users is affected the most by legal risk.
2021-0055,6,"this study proves that gender is able to moderate the perceived risk influence on the intention to continue using fintech, especially in the female user group."
2021-0056,0,this study predicts factors affecting the tendency to use financial technology (fintech) services post-covid-19 lockdown as a new normal behavior.
2021-0056,1,fintech services have boosted the number of users during the covid-19 lockdown.
2021-0056,2,"however, to maintain the loyal behavior of consumers after usage, firms need to predict key reasons to enhance their intention to use the service and maintain current consumers in the long term."
2021-0056,3,this study offers a model to assess the components of the perceived usefulness toward fintech.
2021-0056,4,"data were collected via mechanical turk (mturk), and structural equation modeling was used to predict the factors that influence the intention and loyalty to use fintech post-covid-19 lockdown."
2021-0056,5,"the findings reveal that the covid-19 lockdown, trust, data security and privacy, and especially staff services are factors that enhance the intention to use through perceived usefulness."
2021-0056,6,"in return, it builds consumers loyalty toward fintech services and is considered a new normal behavior."
2021-0056,7,this research sheds light on how fintech firms develop their capabilities and increase their competitive advantages.
2021-0056,8,both theoretical and practical implications are also discussed.
2021-0020,0,the expansion of fintech credit around the world is challenging the global banking system.
2021-0020,1,this study investigates the interrelationships between the development of fintech credit and the efficiency of banking systems in 80 countries from 2013 to 2017. the findings indicate a two-way relationship between them.
2021-0020,2,"more specifically, a negative relationship between bank efficiency and fintech credit implies that fintech credit is more developed in countries with less efficient banking systems."
2021-0020,3,"meanwhile, a positive impact of fintech credit on the efficiency of banking systems suggests that fintech credit may serve as a wake-up call to the banking system."
2021-0020,4,"therefore, fintech credit should be encouraged by the authorities around the world."
2021-0029,0,"financial technology (fintech) has been playing an increasingly critical role in driving modern economies, society, technology, and many other areas."

2021-0015,5,"for the analysis, the structural equation modeling (sem) was used."
2021-0015,6,the study revealed novel results in predicting covid-19 spread.
2021-0015,7,"these three variables (fintech behavior before covid-19, fintech behavior after covid-19, and fintech perception after covid-19) could predict 52.5% of the variance in the dependent variable (covid-19 spread) (r2 = 0.525, p &lt. 0.05)."
2021-0015,8,the findings show that higher fintech perception and behavior among fintech users will help in reducing the spread of covid-19 by avoiding the use of contact payment methods.
2021-0015,9,contactless payment methods are the main tools in fintech that might help in avoiding the probability of covid-19 spread.
2021-0015,10,"consumers' fintech perceptions and behavior are the most influencing factors that could predict the spread of covid-19 in this study, where digital payments are the main concern."
2021-0015,11,"it is recommended that consumers adopt digital payment methods and tools, especially contactless payment methods, to fulfill their financial services."
2021-0015,12,other researchers are also encouraged to use the same model to predict the spread of this virus in the fintech context.

2021-0070,7,the study concluded that fintech predictive modeling allows investment firms to forecast business growth and customer behaviour chnages.
2021-0070,8,it is important for an investment firm to be able to understand business growth by accurately forecasting future growth and survival.
2021-0070,9,"moreover, it is of vital necessity to understand changes in customer buying/consumption behavior so as to develop products and services that suit their needs and preferences."
2021-0070,10,"as a result, predictive modeling is required to project future business growth and changes in customer consumption pattern."
2021-0071,0,financial technology (fintech) is treated as a distinctive taxonomy which majorly examines the financial technology sectors in a broader set of operations for enterprises by the use of information technology (it) applications.
2021-0071,1,"since the internet of things (iot) is increasing tremendously, artificial intelligence (ai) assisted agile iot is the way forward for sustainable finance."
2021-0071,2,"the deepness of the agile iot has probably transformed the financial market today, and it may rapidly develop as a dominant tool in the future."
2021-0071,3,the integration of ai and iot techniques will considerably extract valued financial data and avail better services to the customers.
2021-0071,4,"one of the important concepts involved in fintech is financial crisis prediction (fcp), which is a process of determining the financial status of a company."
2021-0071,5,"with this motivation, this paper designs a novel artificial intelligence assisted iot based fcp (aiaiot-fcp) model in the fintech environment."
2021-0071,6,"the proposed aiaiot-fcp model encompasses different stages such as data collection, data preprocessing, feature selection, and classification."
2021-0071,7,"at the primary stage, the financial data of the enterprises are collected by the use of the iot devices such as smartphones and laptops."
2021-0071,8,"besides, a chaotic henry gas solubility optimization based feature selection (chgso-fs) technique is applied to select optimum features."
2021-0071,9,"in addition, a deep extreme learning machine (delm) based classifier is used to determine the class labels of the financial data."
2021-0071,10,"finally, the nesterov-accelerated adaptive moment estimation (nadam) based hyperparameter optimizer of the delm model is involved to boost the classification performance of the delm model."
2021-0071,11,an extensive simulation analysis is carried out on the benchmark financial dataset to highlight the betterment of the aiaiot-fcp model.
2021-0071,12,the resultant values portrayed the superior performance of the aiaiot-fcp model over the state of art techniques in a considerable way.
2021-0072,0,access to financial services is regarded as one of the most pressing issues confronting communities worldwide sequel to the covid-19 pandemic.
2021-0072,1,"in this regard, fintech applications such as mobile financial service (mfs) play an essential role in building resilience during the pandemic."
2021-0072,2,"hence, the aim of the study is to investigate the role of mfs platforms in economic resilience by empirically evaluating the determinants that influence the intention of bangladeshi users toward adopting mfs platforms during the covid-19 pandemic, through an extension of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (utaut)."
2021-0072,3,"using the core structures of the utaut, the theoretical model was constructed based on the consumption attributes of financial services such as perceived value, as well as additional situational factors from the extended valence framework, including risk and trust."
2021-0072,4,"to test the model, data was obtained from 227 potential mfs users in bangladesh with the aid of a structured questionnaire survey."
2021-0072,5,"subsequently, the structural equation modeling (sem) approach was used to analyze the data."
2021-0072,6,"the findings showed that social influence, perceived trust, and perceived value are strongly related to the intention of users to adopt mfs platforms, whereas, perceived risk, performance expectancy, and effort expectancy were observed to influence users perceived value of the mfs platforms during the covid-19 pandemic."
2021-0072,7,"interestingly, the study results indicated that the users perceived risk did not influence their intention to adopt mfs platforms during the pandemic."
2021-0072,8,"therefore, the suggested adoption of the mfs framework during and after the pandemic could contribute to the existing research on the adoption of information technology (it) through the expansion of the utaut, in which the performance and effort expectancy of users influence their intention to indirectly adopt mfs through perceived value."
2021-0072,9,"finally, the significant policy implications and future research directions are further addressed."
2021-0073,0,the purpose of this paper is to explore determinants of the debt financing of fintech start-ups.
2021-0073,1,"using a new hand-collected multisource database that maps fintech start-ups incorporated in the uk from 2010 to 2015, this study examines how the characteristics of fintech start-ups affect the types of financing used in the first three years after incorporation."
2021-0073,2,the novelty of this study consists in the identification and analysis of the determinants that enable fintech start-ups to obtain long-term debt and hence to finance their growth.
2021-0073,3,the analysis is primarily conducted via a tobit regression model.
2021-0073,4,"this paper contributes to the literature since we still have limited understanding of the financing of fintech firms, even if academic literature examining the financing of start-ups has expanded in the last few years."
2021-0073,5,the results from the empirical analysis demonstrate that unregulated fintech start-ups are more likely to be financed with long-term debt.
2021-0073,6,"asset structure, owner characteristics and the specific fintech activity influence the funding source."
2021-0073,7,"moreover, fintech start-ups backed by equity investors receive less long-term debt funding than their peers."
2021-0073,8,a better understanding of the debt financing of fintech start-ups provides managers with valuable insights into ways of managing their firms.
2021-0073,9,"furthermore, our results have relevant implications for the employment, competition and innovation, given the role that start-ups generally play in the economy."
2021-0073,10,"the study is limited to a sample of fintech start-ups incorporated in an advanced economy, and thus the generalization of the presented results to developing economies will require caution."
2021-0074,0,"in modern times, enhancing energy efficiency is one of the core agenda items for the economies to progress the world."
2021-0074,1,united nations general assembly has recommended increasing energy efficiency by considering the sdg-7 guidelines.
2021-0074,2,"in the contemporary period, e7 economies are deficient in producing the financial resources to ensure the availability of funds for the acquisition of energy efficiency."
2021-0074,3,"covid-19 crises, lack of resilience in economies, devastating fiscal burdens, and tight monetary conditions of e7 economies are the major barriers."
2021-0074,4,"to resolve such issues, some innovative financing techniques, such as green financing, financial inclusion, and fintech, were suggested to investigate."
2021-0074,5,"however, this research tested the empirical role of financial inclusion, green financing, and fintech on the energy efficiency of e7 economies."
2021-0074,6,study findings have shown a significant role of such financing techniques on energy efficiency.
2021-0074,7,"comparatively, green financing is found most fitting and highly supportive financing tool for energy efficiency among the three."
2021-0074,8,"the differences in attributes, financing mechanism, funds flow system, transection systems, and variation in support by the financial institution are the main reasons that lessen the role of financial inclusion and fintech for energy efficiency."
2021-0074,9,"however, theorists must revisit the transaction system of fintech and financial inclusion parameters like green bonds for energy efficiency attainment."
2021-0074,10,"policymakers are suggested to develop viable and energy system-friendly policies to grant green finance to the energy systems of e7 economies, as conveniently as possible."
2021-0075,0,"financial technology-based firms (fintech) are crucial to promoting new technologies and advances in innovations related to the financial field, sustainable development, and financial inclusion."
2021-0075,1,"this paper aims to assess the sustainable development goals (sdgs) and open innovation integrated within the public discourse in the social media of fintech firms, using machine-learning-based social media analysis (sma)."
2021-0075,2,"accordingly, we tracked the behavior of 21 firms based on the empirical material of 32,716 posts on twitter."
2021-0075,3,the outcomes showed dissimilar discourses based on fintech firms activities.
2021-0075,4,"however, it was found that only financial infrastructure, lending, and personal finance fields have a discourse related to innovation and, to a lesser extent, related to the sdgs thematic."
2021-0075,5,"thus, awareness of sustainable objectives is still far from being a relevant issue for fintech, which, in general, has neglected to significantly mention sdgs."
2021-0075,6,"nonetheless, innovation and related terms are a consistent topic in this area."
2021-0075,7,"furthermore, hints of the implementation of the open innovation paradigm and interest in novel technologies are demonstrated, in addition to the promotion of different actors and events on social media that serve as a showcase for firms that have a presence on twitter."
2021-0076,0,"fintech adoption index, expressed as a percentage of the digitally active population, for 27 countries of the world in 2019 reached the level of 64%."
2021-0076,1,"millennials are the generation which, compared to others, is characterized by the highest level of fintech adoptions."
2021-0076,2,"in poland, in 2019, about 75% of the millennials used the services of fintech."
2021-0076,3,this paper aims to analyse and evaluate the selected determinants of using the innovative fintech services by millennials in poland.
2021-0076,4,"to investigate how users adopt fintech services, we have applied our own set of determinants  selected from an extensive literature review  covering both demographic, economic and behavioural characteristics."
2021-0076,5,this approach allowed for an in-depth analysis of the examined issue.
2021-0076,6,the essential empirical data were obtained based on the research using the cawi method in december 2019 on a representative sample of poles aged 2540 at that time.
2021-0076,7,"ultimately, 1,236 correctly completed questionnaires were used for the research."
2021-0076,8,"to analyse and evaluate the impact of selected determinants of fintech adoption, a logistic regression model was used."
2021-0076,9,the results obtained can thus be extremely important for managers of financial institutions.
2021-0076,10,they provide information that can be used for activities aimed at maintaining fintechs customer base and allow to adjust the offer to the expectations of this group.
2021-0076,11,millennials most open to innovative fintech services in poland are young men with high and very high net income and not driven by low costs of financial services.
2021-0076,12,"they appreciate technological novelties, including the possibility of using a smartwatch, and when deciding on the choice of a financial institution, they do not care about the direct opinions of their relatives and friends, but take into account the opinions in social media."
2021-0077,0,purpose: fintech is having a profound impact in sub-saharan africa (ssa) because it offers more financial inclusion.
2021-0077,1,"in this paper, the authors examine the interrelationship of fintech, base of the pyramid (bop) entrepreneurs and social value creation, particularly in the ssa context."
2021-0077,2,"design/methodology/approach: the current paper uses a qualitative research design with open-ended, in-depth interviews as the main data sources."
2021-0077,3,the authors interviewed respondents from the sierra leone fintech association and four bop entrepreneurs operating in different sectors.
2021-0077,4,"findings: the authors find that fintech services, specifically mobile money, play a significant role in reducing uncertainty surrounding business operations."
2021-0077,5,"fintech also offers growth possibilities for bop entrepreneurs and creates social value by providing transactional security, convenience and reducing physical cash robberies."
2021-0077,6,"at the same time, fintech contributes to social value by enhancing bop entrepreneurs as well as consumers' skills development."
2021-0077,7,"research limitations/implications: this study highlights the importance of context-specific theorization when analyzing the interlinkage between bop entrepreneurship, social value creation and fintech."
2021-0077,8,"for example, the possibility of safety from a street robbery may not appear to be part of social value creation by a technological development like fintech."
2021-0077,9,"however, in a country like sierra leone, which has experienced both a civil war and ebola outbreak, insecurity has been one of the biggest concerns expressed by bop inhabitants."
2021-0077,10,"hence, scholars need to incorporate contextual elements of risk, uncertainty and volatility while theorizing on fintech's application in bop contexts."
2021-0077,11,practical implications: a key managerial implication relates to micro-firm entrepreneurs and information specific benefits.
2021-0077,12,fintech offers entrepreneurs the possibility to be in regular contact with customers and evaluate their purchasing patterns as well as emergent needs.
2021-0077,13,fintech offers bop entrepreneurs a possibility to further develop their technological skills as learning to use such apps can be used as a basis for further skills development.
2021-0077,14,"from a policy perspective, our study highlights the importance of regulating fintech charges so that the affordability is increased, which is expected to result in significantly more bop entrepreneurs using these services."
2021-0077,15,"social implications: the authors find that at the same time, fintech contributes to social value by enhancing skills development of bop consumers who interact with case firms."
2021-0077,16,originality/value: this paper is one of the first studies that specifically focuses on bop entrepreneurship and social value creation by fintech services in an ssa context.
2021-0077,17,"it is also one of the few studies that incorporates views from both entrepreneurs and the country's fintech association, rather than focusing solely on either entrepreneurs or fintech firms."
2021-0077,18,"finally, there is a specific focus on bop entrepreneurs engaging in micro-entrepreneurship."
2021-0078,0,financial institutions play a pivotal role in the efficient allocation of capital resources.
2021-0078,1,"however, some households and firms may be excluded from formal financial markets due to asymmetric information and market imperfections, thereby adversely affecting equitable income distribution."
2021-0078,2,"on the other hand, among other things, access to finance is viewed as one of the key tools to fight poverty."
2021-0078,3,"this study develops a novel double ffi model and applies the structural equation modelling to simultaneously analyze the interaction between financial technology, financial inclusion, and income inequality in a panel of 25 african countries over the periods 2011, 2014, and 2017. the results show that financial inclusion mediates the financial technology-income inequality relationship thus playing a fundamental role in reducing income inequality in africa."
2021-0078,4,"on the policy front, the study urges african policymakers and regulators to craft policies that enhance fintech developments and financial inclusion."
2021-0079,0,one of the most modern inventions of financial technology (fintech) since after the global financial crisis of 2008 is the crypto or virtual currency/asset.
2021-0079,1,"since the creation of the first cryptocurrency, the bitcoin, in 2009, it is estimated that over five thousand variants of the bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have emerged."
2021-0079,2,virtual currencies have become widespread across the globe but their legal status and uses in various countries have remained uncertain.
2021-0079,3,"they have been variously classified as currencies, securities, properties, assets, commodities and tokens, and used as means of exchange but are not legally recognised as legal tender."
2021-0079,4,"in many jurisdictions their emergence was greeted with scepticism and express or tacit rejection by financial and securities markets regulators, but over time, owing to their increasing popularity, characteristics, positive and negative potentials, there has been a gradual shift towards their formal recognition and regulation."
2021-0079,5,regulatory authorities in many countries are now grappling with designing appropriate policy and regulatory framework for the crypto phenomenon.
2021-0079,6,"this paper interrogates the current legal status and efforts to regulate cryptocurrencies in two leading african nations, nigeria and south africa, and highlights the challenges of designing an appropriate regulatory framework for this enigmatic technology."
2021-0079,7,"the paper adopts the doctrinal legal research methodology, employing the descriptive, analytical, and comparative approaches."
2021-0079,8,it follows a structured review and analysis of relevant extant legislation on currencies and securities in the countries to ascertain whether they cover cryptocurrencies.
2021-0079,9,it then compares the current position of the law on the subject in the two countries.
2021-0079,10,"bearing in mind that it may not be possible to totally ban dealing in cryptocurrencies, the paper concludes that regulation has become imperative."
2021-0079,11,"drawing from the position on the subject in more developed nations, the united states of america (us) and the european union (eu), this paper proposes a model of regulation of virtual currency not only for nigeria and south africa but also for other african countries."
2021-0080,0,financial technology (fintech) is widely recognised as important in addressing financial inclusion.
2021-0080,1,"however, limited research theorises how new entrants and incumbents work together in fintech ecosystems to shape financial inclusion."
2021-0080,2,"we undertake a theory-generating case study with multilevel interacting organisations in ghana, where, like many other african countries, the growth in fintech has led to new opportunities for financial inclusion."
2021-0080,3,"we conceptualise three practices, as building blocks at the ecosystem level, through which incumbents and new entrants shape financial inclusion: (1) innovative and collaborative practices, (2) protectionist and equitable practices, and (3) legitimising and sustaining practices."
2021-0080,4,"we articulate a theoretical model that explains how the practices shape financial inclusion and propose three theoretical propositions of how financial inclusion in developing countries is being scaled and shaped in terms of actors, relationships, and practices."
2021-0081,0,this article contributes to the discussion about managing the risks and uncertainties of emerging technologies through increased stakeholder participation.
2021-0081,1,"authorities have increasingly invited stakeholders from high-technology sectors to participate in assessing the risks of, and designing responses to, new technologies."
2021-0081,2,yet authorities often struggle to attract stakeholders from such sectors to participate.
2021-0081,3,a critical challenge identified but still undertheorised in the literature.
2021-0081,4,"responding to this gap, this article presents a case study of the uk's regulatory sandbox for financial technologies, applying a document study, questionnaire and interviews to explore fintech firm motivations and apprehensions about participation."
2021-0081,5,"drawing on the bureaucratic reputation literature, the study finds that fintech firms have a range of practical, reputational and normative motivations to participate, and these motivations are inextricably tied to the regulator's strong reputation with the sector as procedurally correct, high-performing and morally committed to facilitating innovation."
2021-0081,6,"on this basis, recommendations for practitioners and hypotheses for future research into the drivers of stakeholder participation in regulatory decision-making surrounding emerging technologies are proposed."
2021-0082,0,the huge advancement in the field of communication has pushed the innovation pace towards a new concept in the context of internet of things (iot) named iot for financial technology applications (iot-fintech).
2021-0082,1,the main intention is to leverage the businesses&#x2019.
2021-0082,2,income and reducing cost by facilitating the benefits enabled by iot-fintech technology.
2021-0082,3,"to do so, some of the challenging problems that mainly related to routing protocols in such highly dynamic, unreliable (due to mobility) and widely distributed network need to be carefully addressed."
2021-0082,4,this paper therefore focuses on developing a new trustworthy and efficient routing mechanism to be used in routing data traffic over iot-fintech mobile networks.
2021-0082,5,a new non-linear l&#x00e9.vy brownian generalized normal distribution optimization (nlbgndo) algorithm is proposed to solve the problem of finding an optimal path from source to destination sensor nodes to be used in forwarding fintech&#x2019.s related data.
2021-0082,6,we also propose an objective function to be used in maintaining trustworthiness of the selected relay-node candidates by introducing a trust-based friendship mechanism to be measured and applied during each selection process.
2021-0082,7,"the formulated model also considering node&#x2019.s residual energy, experienced response time, and inter-node distance (to figure out density/sparsity ratio of sensor nodes)."
2021-0082,8,results demonstrate that our proposed mechanism could maintain very wise and efficient decisions over the selection period in comparison with other methods.

2021-0083,0,this study took online lending as the main research object to quantitatively measure fintech risk in china.
2021-0083,1,a theoretical model was built to analyse the relationship between the assets and liabilities of peer-to-peer platforms and the risk of the entire online lending industry.
2021-0083,2,the conditional value at risk method was used to measure the risk spillover effect of the online lending industry and the different types of platforms.
2021-0083,3,index smoothing and moving average were used to examine risk contagion.
2021-0083,4,"when the risk rate of the portfolio of the platform generally increases, the systemic risk of the whole industry also increases, and if the systemic risk of the industry spreads to the portfolio of the platform, it could affect the stability of the capital flow of the platform, and then affect the risk expectation of the platform itself."
2021-0083,5,most platforms with risk concerns were private.
2021-0083,6,banking platforms and public platforms were greatly affected by market risk.
2021-0083,7,"however, their own risks had relatively little impact on the overall market."
2021-0083,8,"the greater the market risk, the more platforms become risk platforms, and the smaller the impact on transition platforms."
2021-0083,9,regulatory sandboxes may be an effective means of preventing and controlling fintech risks.
2021-0084,0,the development of smartphones and mobile internet technologies has promoted the development of mobile payments worldwide.
2021-0084,1,the core purpose of this study is to ascertain what the main factors are which affect dutch customers adoption and experience of mobile payments.
2021-0084,2,"this study first addresses the concepts of mobile payments and customer experience and then explores the current dutch financial and banking systems, before attempting to understand the recent researches worldwide on mobile payments."
2021-0084,3,"based on quantitative research methods, the study examines the factors that influence the adoption and experience of mobile payments and the impacts of the covid-19 outbreak on payment methods due to social distancing rules in the netherlands."
2021-0084,4,"it finds that perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, safety and trust are the main factors that affect the adoption of mobile payments, and mobile-payment providers need to improve technical protection and offer some benefits to boost the mobile-payment business."
2021-0084,5,the covid-19 outbreak has caused the decline of cash payments and the increase of contactless payments in the netherlands.
2021-0084,6,mobile payments ensure peoples health and help slow down the spread of the virus.
2021-0038,0,implementation of sdgs is the unified goal of 193 un member states.
2021-0038,1,fintech plays a crucial role in achieving it.
2021-0038,2,"therefore, the development of fintech must be facilitated through proper policy-making and public finance, creating beneficial pest conditions."
2021-0038,3,"however, the interaction of the fintech pest environment and achievement of sdgs is a topic that has not yet been addressed."
2021-0038,4,"the purpose of this study is to assess the link between these two indicators using statistical methods, indicate sdgs having the strongest link to fintech pest environment, and explain the interface to facilitate its useful application within government and financial regulations, as well as administration of the state and municipal financial entities."
2021-0038,5,"the results show that the economic and investment potential of northern europe is caused by the most favorable pest environment for fintech sector development, and demonstrate the existence of a statistical link between fintech pest environment and sdg4, sdg8, sdg9, sdg16."

2021-0086,0,"while regulation of financial intermediaries has been embraced because the industry is particularly prone to market failures, disintermediation has the potential to make current frameworks obsolete."
2021-0086,1,"the law and economics problem is twofold: (1) potential market failures, and (2) the issue of enforcement."
2021-0086,2,this chapter discusses the foundations of financial intermediation and the traditional regulatory approaches to both banks and other providers of financial services.
2021-0086,3,our analysis establishes a distinction between fintechs working outside and inside the blockchain.
2021-0086,4,"for the former, the crucial regulatory trade-off is between efficiency gains from innovation and regulatory arbitrage."
2021-0086,5,"for the latter, our analysis suggests that regulating the convertibility of cryptocurrencies into fiat money is a promising strategy not only to safeguard financial stability, but also to attract financial services to the regulatory perimeter, whenever it is efficient to do so."
2021-0040,0,advances in information and communication technology (ict) have provided a platform for the introduction and diffusion of a range of financial technologies that have transformed the financial sector.
2021-0040,1,this study analyses the diffusion of financial technology (fintech) and its interaction with financial inclusion and living standards (gdp per capita).
2021-0040,2,we consider the determinants and effects of technology diffusion in financial services and identify two possible transmission mechanisms from the financial sector to gdp per capitaa fintech diffusion channel and a financial inclusion channel.
2021-0040,3,we specify the interactions between these two channels and their relationship with income per capita.
2021-0040,4,our empirical analysis focuses on the diffusion of two enabling fintech innovations: atms and associated digital networks.
2021-0040,5,and mobile phones and payments systems.
2021-0040,6,"the relationships between fintech diffusion, financial inclusion and gdp per capita are estimated using a panel data set for up to 137 countries over the period 19912015 using both cross section and panel techniques, including an error correction model that distinguishes short- and long-run effects."
2021-0040,7,a key finding is that fintech diffusion and financial inclusion have long-run effects on gdp per capita over and above their short-run impact and the effects of investment in fixed and human capital.
2021-0013,0,the purpose of this research is to define the level of significance for various indicators that influence the degree of consumer satisfaction regarding the use of fintech technologies and services.

2021-0089,0,the fintech index has been more active in the stock market with the fintech industry expanding.
2021-0089,1,the prediction of the fintech index is significant as it is capable of instructing investors to avoid risks and provide guidance for financial regulators.
2021-0089,2,traditional prediction methods adopt the deep neural network (dnn) or the combination of genetic algorithm (ga) and dnn mostly.
2021-0089,3,"however, heavy computational load is required by these algorithms."
2021-0089,4,"in this paper, we propose an integrated artificial intelligence-based algorithm, consisting of the random frog algorithm (rf), ga, and dnn, to predict the fintech index."
2021-0089,5,the proposed rf-ga-dnn prediction algorithm filters the key input variables and optimizes the hyperparameters of dnn.
2021-0089,6,we compare the proposed rf-ga-dnn with the traditional ga-dnn in terms of convergence time and prediction accuracy.
2021-0089,7,results show that the convergence time of ga-dnn is up to 20 hours and its prediction accuracy is 97.4%.
2021-0089,8,"in comparison, the convergence time of our rf-ga-dnn is only about 1.5 hours and the prediction accuracy reaches 97.0%."
2021-0089,9,these results demonstrate that the proposed rf-ga-dnn prediction algorithm significantly reduces the convergence time with the promise of competitive prediction accuracy.
2021-0089,10,"thus, the proposed algorithm deserves to be widely recommended for predicting the fintech index."
2021-0090,0,"building on critical approaches that understand algorithms in terms of communication, culture and organization, this paper offers the supplementary conceptualization of algorithms as organizational figuration, defined as material and meaningful sociotechnical arrangements that develop in spatiotemporal processes and are shaped by multiple enactments of affordanceagency relations."
2021-0090,1,we develop this conceptualization through a case study of a danish fintech start-up that uses machine learning to create opportunities for sustainable pensions investments.
2021-0090,2,"by way of ethnographic and literary methodology, we provide an in-depth analysis of the dynamic trajectory in and through which the organization gives shape to and takes shape from its key algorithmic tool, mapping the shifting sociotechnical arrangements of the start-up, from its initial search for a viable business model through the development of the algorithm to the public launch of its product."
2021-0090,3,"on this basis, we argue that conceptualizing algorithms as organizational figuration enables us to detail not only what algorithms do but also what they are."
2021-0091,0,the peer to peer lending financial technology corporation as a digital-based intermediary has two types of agency relationships: (1) between financial technology corporation as an agent with investors as a principal.
2021-0091,1,(2) between financial technology corporation as an agent and the small-medium enterprises as a third party (debtors).
2021-0091,2,"both of these agency relationships currently run independently and are separate from other agency relationships, so they are not effective in improving performance."
2021-0091,3,"therefore, the purpose of this article is to develop a conceptual framework of the e-integrated corporate governance model at the peer to peer lending financial technology corporation to improve sustainability performance."
2021-0091,4,"the research method in this article was reviewing articles related to corporate governance, finding gaps and limitations."
2021-0091,5,"the results of this study are that because business processes in financial technology corporations are interconnected systems, both corporate governances must be integrated with information technology, in order to improve sustainability performance."
2021-0091,6,"with this model, asymmetric information between the three parties (depositors/investors, financial technology corporation, and small-medium enterprises) and all stakeholders can be eliminated, risks can be reduced, business processes and financial and non-financial information of the three parties is more transparent and accessible for all stakeholders."
2021-0092,0,the financial stability board defines financial technology (fintech) as technology-enabled innovation in financial services.
2021-0092,1,"at the 2015 world economic forum, experts proposed a taxonomy for financial services that can be classified into six major categories: payments, deposits and lending, market provisioning, capital raising, insurance, and investment management."
2021-0092,2,"because financial opinion mining can be applied to many listed services, we survey various cases in this chapter and show that financial opinion mining is useful and crucial in many financial application scenarios."
2021-0093,0,digital finance has changed the landscape of financial service provision worldwide.

2021-0093,4,"against the backdrop of decades of generally unsuccessful attempts to expand financial coverage in rural areas by conventional bricks-and-mortar financial institutions, these two rural fintech models have the potential to expand digital financial service provision in new ways."
2021-0093,5,"this paper critically examines these fintech models, contextualises them within the broader trajectory of pushes to expand digital financial inclusion worldwide, considers the parallels with agricultural supplier contracting systems elsewhere, and explores the potential benefits and risks that they pose for rural development and rural livelihoods in china and elsewhere."
2021-0094,0,scholars and practitioners continue to recognize the crucial role of entrepreneurial ecosystems (ees) in creating a conducive environment for productive entrepreneurship.
2021-0094,1,"although ees are fundamentally interaction systems of hierarchically independent yet mutually dependent actors, few studies have investigated how interactions among ecosystem actors drive the entrepreneurial process."
2021-0094,2,"seeking to address this gap, this paper explores how ecosystem actor interactions influence new ventures in the financial technology (fintech) ee of singapore."
2021-0094,3,"guided by an ee framework and the use of an exploratory-abductive approach, empirical data from semi-structured interviews is collected and analyzed."
2021-0094,4,"the findings reveal four categories representing both the relational perspective, which features interaction and intermediation dynamics, and the cultural perspective, which encompasses ecosystem development and regulatory dynamics."
2021-0094,5,these categories help explain how and why opportunity identification and resource exploitation are accelerated or inhibited for entrepreneurs in fintech ees.
2021-0094,6,the present study provides valuable contributions to scholars and practitioners interested in ees and contributes to the academic understanding of the emerging fintech phenomenon.
2021-0035,0,this article evaluates the sandbox approach as a regulatory answer to the challenges financial technology brings to finance and social relations.
2021-0035,1,"taking fintech as a sociotechnological phenomenon embedded in discourses of solutionism and innovation, we show that the regulatory sandbox accepts these discourses."
2021-0035,2,"instead of containing fintech, the sandbox is designed in a way that advances riskwashing of fintech even if it is disguised as risktaming."
2021-0035,3,"next, we demonstrate fintechs problematic nature that regulation should control."
2021-0035,4,"first, we propose that through its information processing capacity, fintech accelerates the transition from bank-based to market-based finance."
2021-0035,5,"second, we demonstrate that fintech as part of a fintech-financialization apparatus has catallactic and value-extracting governance effects."
2021-0035,6,"third, inserting the fintech-financialization apparatus into fourcade and healys argument on the social stratification effect of the data-driven economy, we argue that it also has a socially disruptive potential."
2021-0035,7,we critique the regulatory sandbox for being a facilitator to this process and recommend increasing the number and power of veto players and veto points in complex regulatory regimes.
2021-0095,0,the financial landscape is being transformed by technological innovations.
2021-0095,1,this trend can be observed clearly in the uk where fintech is developing within the context of the ongoing digitalization of the economy.
2021-0095,2,this paper examines the role of the british government and regulatory authorities in sparking innovation to improve the way financial services are provided.
2021-0095,3,"at the conceptual level, fintech-specific policy presumes the existence of complex trade-offs between competition, market integrity, and financial stability."
2021-0095,4,the special consideration is given to open banking initiative as a key driver of competition in financial services sector.
2021-0095,5,by removing barriers to entry and grow for fintech firms the policy enablers try to solve the longstanding problems of financial exclusion.

2021-0096,0,"new technologies have been driving the global financial market, including fintech companies, which provide disruptive financial services in which information technology is the key factor."
2021-0096,1,the objective of this study is to identify which factors most influence intentions to continue using these companies products.
2021-0096,2,"to achieve this, research by ryu (2018) was replicated."
2021-0096,3,our adopted model evaluates the weight of seven factors composing two latent variables  perceived risk and perceived benefit  in the continuity of use of these services.
2021-0096,4,"the data collection was performed through an electronic survey, distributed through social networks during may and june of 2019. the main results confirmed seven of the eleven initial hypotheses, highlighting that the perceived benefits, especially the economic ones, were relevant to early adopters and seamless transactions were relevant for late adopters."
2021-0096,5,"surprisingly, perceived risk was not a determinant of continuance intention."
2021-0096,6,"one of the contributions of this study is that it indicates some possible demographic and behavioral characteristics of brazilian fintech consumers, opening up space for a better understanding of the market and service improvements."
2021-0014,0,financial technology have revolutionized the delivery and usage of the autonomous operations and processes to improve the financial services.
2021-0014,1,"however, the massive amount of data (often called as big data) generated seamlessly across different geographic locations can end end up as a bottleneck for the underlying network infrastructure."
2021-0014,2,"to mitigate this challenge, software-defined network (sdn) has been leveraged in the proposed approach to provide scalability and resilience in multi-controller environment."
2021-0014,3,"however, in case if one of these controllers fail or cannot work as per desired requirements, then either the network load of that controller has to be migrated to another suitable controller or it has to be divided or balanced among other available controllers."
2021-0014,4,"for this purpose, the proposed approach provides an adaptive recovery mechanism in a multi-controller sdn setup using support vector machine-based classification approach."
2021-0014,5,"the proposed work defines a recovery pool based on the three vital parameters, reliability, energy, and latency."
2021-0014,6,"a utility matrix is then computed based on these parameters, on the basis of which the recovery controllers are selected."

2021-0005,1,"the relatively new emerging paradigms in various sciences, such as geometry (fractals), physics (quantum), and database systems (distributed ledgerblockchain), seem to potentially contribute to a greater shift in the framework of the finance industry, bringing also some concerns (cyber-threats)."
2021-0005,2,"consistent and extensive investigation of the reasonable potential impact of these new models (and their underlying technologies) is performed, and then tested through a swot analysis, as the main objective of this research."
2021-0005,3,threats and opportunities are always intrinsically driven by the introduction of technological advancements (revolutions).
2021-0005,4,this research confirms that information availability and the increasing interconnection of crosswise applications of each discovery to the different fields of science is determining the rapid succession of revolutions identified by evident large shifts in economic paradigms.
2021-0005,5,"the growing computing capacity and the development of increasingly powerful predictive software are leading to a competitive, extremely dynamic, and challenging system."
2021-0005,6,"in this context, as shown by history, there is a high possibility of market concentration in which, however, only a few corporationsdigital giantscan afford to develop these technologies, consolidating their dominance."
2021-0036,0,the recent increase of robo-advisory services (ras) in various financial domains has caused a threatening alarm to the traditional fund and wealth management industry.

2021-0000,2,"the results of dy suggest that, first, the total connectedness of 21st century technology assets and traditional common stocks is very high, and hence in the turbulent economy, there is a high probability of contemporaneous losses."
2021-0000,3,"second, bitcoin, msciw, msci us, and kftx are net contributors of volatility shocks whereas us dollar, oil, gold, vix, green bond and green bond select are net receivers."
2021-0000,4,"therefore, fintech and common equities are not good hedging instruments in the same portfolio."
2021-0000,5,"third, the short-term witnesses higher volatility transmission than the long-term."
2021-0000,6,"that is, holding assets for a long-term is likely to mitigate risks whereas trading financial assets in the short-term can increase risk because of higher volatility."
2021-0000,7,"fourth, the traditional assets, gold and oil, as well as modern assets, green bonds, are useful as good hedgers compared with other assets because shock transmissions from them to fintech, kftx are below 0.1% and, more importantly, the total volatility spill-over of all assets in the sample is moderately average, accounting for 44.39%."

2021-0001,0,fintech is the digital sector of retail money and finance widely proclaimed to be transforming banking in the global north and banking the unbanked in the global south.
2021-0001,1,"this paper develops a perspective for critically understanding fintech as a platform political economy that is marked by three distinctive and related processes: reintermediation, consolidation, and capitalisation."
2021-0001,2,"through experimentation with the platform business model and building on the digital infrastructures and data flows of the broader platform ecosystem, a constellation of organisationsincluding start-ups, early-career firms, bigtech companies and incumbent banksare engaged in processes of platform reintermediation."
2021-0001,3,"changing the bases of competition in retail money and financial markets and encouraging oligopoly and even monopoly, the reintermediation processes of fintech are presently manifest in strong tendencies towards platform consolidation."
2021-0001,4,"the imagined potential of fintech has also triggered intensive processes of capitalisation, with platforms receiving significant prospective investment by venture capital, private equity funds, banks and bigtech firms."
2020-0048,0,"in modern russia, the fintech is relevant to the development of the financial segment of the economy."
2020-0048,1,"the government evaluates the prospects of development of artificial intelligence technology, blockchain, big data in the area of budget, tax, customs and other relations by now."
2020-0048,2,"however, the development of the fintech in russia faces many problems."
2020-0048,3,"first of all, these is the absence of digital infrastructure for mining cryptocurrency, issues related to information security, the potential risks of illegal non-personalized transactions through the blockchain technology."
2020-0048,4,it is necessary to analyze the content of the discovered institutional problems and to determine the ways to resolve them.
2020-0048,5,"the significant role in overcoming the difficulties is assigned to the federal law ""about the digital financial assets"", which shall enter into force on the 1st of january 2021. besides the foreign experience in overcoming the difficulties related to the utilization of fintech is particularly valuable for russia to solve the identified issues effectively."
2020-0049,0,this paper primarily focused on the concept and correlation between the trust mechanism and currency system iterations from the early civilization age till nowadays.
2020-0049,1,"structured as starting from diving into the history and evolution of the ""format of the money"", by illustrating the changes associated with ""trust""and ""convenience""as a timeline, and finally research into the ultimate of the current money - bitcoin and cryptocurrency."
2020-0031,0,"the financial services industry is currently undergoing a major transformation, with digitization and sustainability being the core drivers."
2020-0031,1,"while both concepts have been researched in recent years, their intersection, often conceived as green fintech, remains underdetermined."
2020-0031,2,"therefore, this paper contributes to this important discussion about green fintech by, first, synthesizing the relevant literature systematically."
2020-0031,3,"second, it shows the results of an empirical, in-depth analysis of the swiss fintech landscape both in terms of green fintech startups as well as the services offered by the incumbents."
2020-0031,4,"the research results show that literature in this new domain has only emerged recently, is mostly characterized by a specific focus on isolated aspects of green fintech and does not provide a comprehensive perspective on the topic yet."
2020-0031,5,"in addition, the results from the literature and the market analysis indicate that green fintech has an impact along the whole value chain of financial services covering customertocustomer (c2c), businesstocustomer (b2c), and businesstobusiness (b2b) services."
2020-0031,6,today the field is predominantly captured by startup companies in contrast to the incumbents whose solutions are still rare.
2020-0016,0,digital transformation creates challenges in all industries and business sectors.
2020-0016,1,"the development of digital transformation has also clearly triggered the emergence of fintech (financial technology) initiatives, which are recognized as some of the most important innovations in the financial industry."
2020-0016,2,"these initiatives are developing rapidly, driven in part by the sharing economy, regulations, and information technology."
2020-0016,3,"however, research in the field of fintech remains in its infancy."
2020-0016,4,"fintech offers several services, such as funding, payment (including electronic wallets), e-aggregators, e-trading, and e-insurance, and cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin."
2020-0016,5,this provides an opportunity to more closely examine fintechs research challenges and trends.
2020-0016,6,this study aims to (1) determine the state of the art of financial technology research.
2020-0016,7,(2) identify gaps in the financial technology research field.
2020-0016,8,and (3) identify challenges and trends for future research potential.
2020-0016,9,the novel proposal in this study includes theoretical contributions regarding financial technology.
2020-0016,10,"using the systematic literature review approach of kitchenham, in addition to thematic analysis, meta-analysis and observation to validate the quality of literature and analysis, the results of this study provide a theoretical basis fintech research from an information systems perspective, including the formulation of fintech technology concepts and their development."
2020-0038,0,"the financial services sector, perhaps more than any other, is being disrupted by advances in technology."
2020-0038,1,the purpose of this study is to provide comprehensive data and evidence on value of the fintech innovation event.
2020-0038,2,"first, a text-based filtering method for identifying fintech patent applications is provided."
2020-0038,3,"using machine learning applications, innovations are classified into major technology groups."
2020-0038,4,the methodology for valuation of fintech innovation is based on data of stock price changes.
2020-0038,5,"to assess the value impact, poisson flow rates and stock price movements were combined."
2020-0038,6,"further, to evaluate the effect of fintech patents on the companys value, a combination of car of patent application and poisson intensities were used."
2020-0038,7,research findings provide evidence that fintech innovations bring significant value for innovators and blockchain being especially valuable.
2020-0038,8,"such innovations as blockchain, robo-advising and mobile transactions are the most valuable for the financial sector."
2020-0038,9,"on one side of the spectrum, the financial industry can be affected more negatively by the innovation of nonfinancial startups that carry disruptive technology at their core."
2020-0038,10,"however, on the other side of the spectrum, market leaders who make significant investments in their innovations can evade most of these negative effects."
2020-0038,11,this helped to form an overall view of fintech innovations.
2020-0006,0,accessing financial services is considered one of the main challenges facing communities during crises.
2020-0006,1,this research studies the role of using fintech applications to build resilience during the covid-19 pandemic.
2020-0006,2,the research empirically examines the factors affecting jordanian citizens intention to use fintech applications.
2020-0006,3,the sample of the research comprised 500 potential fintech service users in jordan.
2020-0006,4,"based on the research conceptual model, five hypotheses were developed and tested using structural equation modeling techniques (sem-pls)."
2020-0006,5,the research results indicate that perceived benefits and social norms significantly affect the intention to use fintech applications.
2020-0006,6,"however, it has been found that perceived technology risks do not significantly affect the intention to use fintech applications."
2020-0006,7,"moreover, the results also indicate that customer trust is significantly mediating the relationship between perceived risks and intention to use fintech applications."
2020-0006,8,"fintech service providers should insure that their products are easy to use, fulfill needs and protect consumers data in order to ensure trust, hence positively influencing consumer adoption."
2020-0050,0,the financial industry is one of the earliest and most comprehensive industries that integrate with artificial intelligence.
2020-0050,1,"the application of a series of artificial intelligence technologies such as data mining, accurate profiling, machine learning, neural networks, will provide financial products, service channels, service methods, risk management, credit financing and investment decision-making have brought about a new round of changes."
2020-0050,2,"firstly, the rapid development of artificial intelligence has a profound impact on the high-end finance of the deep service value chain."
2020-0050,3,"secondly, the integrated development of artificial intelligence and finance is irreversible, risks and opportunities coexist, and the financial industry must accelerate the pace of adjustment and development."
2020-0050,4,"finally, the financial supervision department further clarifies the supervision responsibility, applies artificial intelligence technology to supervision methods and means, and improves the degree of supervision automation and intelligence."
2020-0051,0,"nowadays, the existence of a fintech entity is a necessity."
2020-0051,1,the choice is disruption or collaboration.
2020-0051,2,this study investigates the antecedents of fintech collaboration based on leadership styles and its consequence on competitive advantage.
2020-0051,3,the study is a quantitative causality approach using a questionnaire to collect the data and use structural equation modelling to analyse it.
2020-0051,4,"there are 166 respondents, as samples, from 479 supervisors to directors of automotive, electronics, and food and beverage of medium and large companies."
2020-0051,5,results show that leadership styles have a positive effect on competitive advantage and fintech collaboration.
2020-0051,6,this study's original value is that fintech collaboration is a necessity for managerial decisions as a mediator for competitive advantage based on leadership styles.
2020-0051,7,"it concludes that the primary antecedent choice in encouraging fintech collaboration is transactional leadership, and collaboration with the fintech entity to create a competitive advantage is necessary."
2020-0051,8,"meanwhile, for further research, it is assumed that suitable leadership to encourage competitive advantage through fintech is transformational leadership, and collaborate with the fintech entity is a must."
2020-0024,0,this paper explores the most recent fintech (financial technology) phenomenon from an ecosystem perspective.
2020-0024,1,"differentiated from the earlier fintech evolution led by traditional financial institutions, cross-sector fintech that operates at the intersection of financial services and information technology disrupts existing business models of banks while creating novel ecosystem dynamics."
2020-0024,2,this study explores the fintech ecosystem composition to understand better business model innovation based on underlying ecosystem dynamics while focusing on the specific role of cross-sector actors.
2020-0024,3,these actors have escaped scrutiny despite being mature and experienced and having strong resource bases.
2020-0024,4,"adopting a comparative case study method by considering the china-based alibaba group and tencent, the studys findings indicate that novel business model developments based on strong technological expertise and scale-based resources by cross-sector fintech render a functional perspective on fast-developing fintech industry less practical."
2020-0024,5,"apart from cross-sector fintech, investors constitute a new dimension in the conceptualization of the fintech ecosystem."
2020-0024,6,"overall, the interconnectedness of the cross-sector fintech beyond the fintech sectors drives the fuzzy boundaries between ecosystems, established business models, terminology definitions, ecosystem actors roles and relationships, which appear to become more heterogeneous and changeable over time."
2020-0024,7,the study contributes to the scant literature on fintech ecosystems and their sustainable development.
2020-0013,0,"in the introduction to the first-ever special issue on the spatial dimensions of fintech, we show that despite a fintech fever in business and media, research on fintech is still niche, particularly in social sciences."
2020-0013,1,"we describe fintech as a research area full of controversies, ripe and in need of geographical research."
2020-0013,2,"as we outline, papers in this issue contribute to the debate primarily by examining the role of the state, financial centres and uneven development in fintech."
2020-0019,0,this paper analyses how different entrepreneurial actors respond to political uncertainty and changing institutional settings.
2020-0019,1,"moreover, it discusses the impact of those actor-level responses on the resilience of entrepreneurial ecosystems (ees), focusing on how they affect the diversity of and the connectivity among its actors."
2020-0019,2,"to address these questions, the paper examines how the decision of the united kingdom to leave the european union has influenced the financial technology (fintech) industry in london, applying data collected from in-depth interviews, covering different groups of stakeholders in londons fintech industry, such as angel investors, banks, legal advisers, lobby organizations and private companies."
2020-0019,3,"our results show that political uncertainty and the prospect of institutional change can trigger actor-level responses, which have the potential to modify the diversity as well as the local and non-local connectivity of an ee."
2020-0019,4,"moreover, we demonstrate that the nature of strategic responses of entrepreneurial actors varies significantly, depending on their firms characteristics, such as age, size, product specialization and the structure of their egocentric networks."
2020-0019,5,"with regard to the latter, our results show that anchor firms play an important role in other firms egocentric networks and have the power to shape their strategic responses."
2020-0009,0,fintech and digital financial services involve the delivery of financial products and services through technology.
2020-0009,1,"fintech companies are part of a financial lending infrastructure claiming to offer an alternative to big banks, and are often touted as digitally disruptive technology that is rapidly reshaping financial inclusion agendas and improving the lives of the poor."
2020-0009,2,"for many refugees living in camps and informal settlements in kenya, fintech is often the only viable option for credit or microfinance aid."
2020-0009,3,"while refugees are often excluded from credit, the spread of fintech as a solution for direct peer-to-peer aid transfers from the global north to refugees has resulted in the uneven distribution of credit access and livelihood support."
2020-0009,4,"through fintech, private citizens and groups in the global north are able to disrupt and subvert refugee assistance, deeming some worthy of aid while others face ongoing exclusion."
2020-0009,5,"while fintech remains a hopeful source of greater efficiency and empowerment, the direct transfer of aid money masks profit and corporate power by only extending assistance to those refugees who are appropriately entrepreneurial, that is to say those who will start small businesses and pay back their loans."
2020-0009,6,this paper argues that processes of financial inclusion carried out by and through fintech are still distinguished largely by exclusion.
2020-0009,7,"in so doing, this paper highlights a theoretical position that refugee governance is embedded in racial forms of capital accumulation and expropriation."
2020-0040,0,"the emergence of new technologies and players, along with a favorable regulatory framework (psd2 directive), is changing the banking industry."
2020-0040,1,fintechs and techfins have allowed the introduction of new services and changed the way customers interact to satisfy their financial needs.
2020-0040,2,the fintech landscape is constantly evolving in the market.
2020-0040,3,"different business value propositions are entering the financial services industry, moving from increasing the user's experience to developing a time to market framework for banks to innovate products, processes, and channels, increasing the cost efficiency and looking for a partnering on order to lighten the regulatory burdens for banks."
2020-0040,4,"the many businesses of banks are changing their value chains, and banks' business models should do the same accordingly."
2020-0040,5,strategists could no longer take their value chains as a given.
2020-0040,6,"choices have to be made on what needs to be protected and maintained, what abandoned and the new on coming to make banks evolve and become more resilient in doing their job."
2020-0040,7,"banking is shifting significantly from a pipeline, vertical paradigm, to open banking business models where open innovation, modularity, and ecosystem-based bank's business model may become the ongoing mainstream and paradigm to follow and develop."
2020-0040,8,opportunities and threats for banks are many and new ones to re-gaining their role in the market throughout a re-intermediation process.
2020-0032,0,an asset allocation optimization model for key clients and financial products is developed and deployed on a business platform by compiling a program to a module using matlab to show how to integrate financial big data and fintech in a real application for a bank.
2020-0032,1,"firstly, we establish a single objective linear programming model with the percent of assets in products as the decision variables, the minimum-weighted duration as the objective, and the business requirements as constraints."
2020-0032,2,"then, we select non-integer linear programming as the model solver by testing two algorithm solvers with six real test cases separately, according to the solving time."
2020-0032,3,"finally, we directly compile the model and the algorithm program into a module to complete the deployment into a business platform to quickly complete the transformation of data and model the actual productivity of the bank."
2020-0018,0,"after the 200708 global financial crisis, research flourished on entrepreneurship through digital innovation in the financial market as well as on investors influence on digital technology-based entrepreneurs funding decisions."
2020-0018,1,"this study combines these two research streams to analyze the decision-making criteria for funding financial technology companies (fintechs), hybrid companies that combine digital entrepreneurship, technology, and banking."
2020-0018,2,the study first uses prior literature to derive important characteristics to define fintechs and then uses 12 expert interviews to elaborate on decision-making criteria in funding.
2020-0018,3,"except for smaller peculiarities, fintech funding does not appear to differ from that of other digital entrepreneurship in different markets, andas with most digital business modelsscalability was identified as a key criterion."
2020-0018,4,"additionally, by serving as a major provider of money for young companies, banks have changed their role and positioning in funding new financial technology entrepreneurs."
2020-0018,5,"through developments in digital technology, banks have shifted from traditional money-lending activities (i.e., debt-financing) to becoming stakeholders in fintechs and, hence, equity investors."
2020-0018,6,"we also describe how these formerly distinct fields have converged due to regulatory requirements, digital newcomers, and a need for constant innovation, with their future sustainable development dependent on sharing and collaboration."
2020-0052,0,"to determine the micro-operating mechanism(mom) of enterprises participating in the regulatory sandbox policy in fintech, this study analyzes the structure of enterprise innovation competencies and derives relevant implications."
2020-0052,1,"the results reveal that large, middle-standing, and small and medium-sized enterprises focus on security, infrastructure, and user-related technology development, respectively, to enhance their innovation competencies."
2020-0052,2,the security-related issues considered by large enterprises entail relatively high costs in initial technology development and are closely related to infrastructure building.
2020-0052,3,"large enterprises are focused on developing overall security-related technologies, whereas middle-standing enterprises are striving to develop infrastructure-related technologies, with particular emphasis on elementary technologies."
2020-0052,4,small and medium-sized enterprises are also making efforts to develop user-centered technologies that can directly be used in fintech.
2020-0052,5,"as a method to implement regulatory sandboxes tailored to the needs of participating enterprises in south korea, this study will help to determine the mom of such participants and establish strategies to support them sustainably in terms of evidence-based policy."
2020-0053,0,this article engages with the critical study of contemporary publicity by examining transparency as a strategic project to platformize financial services.
2020-0053,1,the article contributes to understandings of transparency as value cocreation in business-to-business markets.
2020-0053,2,"through field-level discourse analysis, the article shows that transparency is contingent primarily on the nature of the market, in this case, a platformized industry, which valorizes transparency as part of a regime of data sharing and open access."
2020-0053,3,transparency is further contingent on the market actor: actors with lesser status and market legitimacy are more likely to seek to cocreate transparency with market actors of greater or similar status and legitimacy.
2020-0053,4,"the article concludes that in commercial spaces, publicitys relationship to transparency is not only determined by market logic, but that all market logics are being drawn further toward a technological definition of transparency as shareveillance, as more segments of economic life become platformized."
2020-0026,0,"new financial technology holds the promise of innovation and competition, challenging established products and services and frequently improving market processes."
2020-0026,1,"however, regulation of these new services faces a double challenge: to keep pace with innovation and facilitate new market entries while at the same time understanding and managing the regulatory risks that are involved."
2020-0026,2,"at this stage, the existing eu regulatory framework is of little help: the bulk of the present body of financial regulation stems from a different time, with different regulatory problems in mind."
2020-0026,3,eu regulation is also very slow to change and to adapt.
2020-0026,4,"therefore, this paper proposes a regulatory ""sandbox""- an experimentation space - as a step towards a regulatory environment where such new business models can thrive."
2020-0026,5,"a sandbox would allow market participants to test fintech services in the real market, with real consumers, but under the close scrutiny of the supervisor."
2020-0026,6,"the benefit of such an approach is that it fuels the development of new business practices and reduces the ""time to market""cycle of financial innovation, while simultaneously safeguarding consumer protection."
2020-0026,7,"at the same time, a sandbox allows for mutual learning in a technical field which is sometimes poorly understood, both for firms and for the regulator."
2020-0026,8,this would help to reduce the prevalent regulatory uncertainty for all market participants.
2020-0026,9,"in the particular eu legal framework with various layers of legal instruments, the implementation of such a sandbox is not straightforward."
2020-0026,10,"in this paper, we propose a ""guided sandbox"", operated by the eu member states, but with endorsement, support, and monitoring by eu institutions."
2020-0026,11,"this innovative approach would be somewhat uncharted territory for the eu, and thereby also contribute to the future development of eu financial market governance as a whole."
2020-0011,0,"despite high expectations for the growth of fintech, it has not reached the expected growth in the real world."
2020-0011,1,"as fintech is innovative but inherently unpredictable, customers are still hesitant to adopt and use fintech, which ultimately affects its growth."
2020-0011,2,"to achieve the sustainable development and growth of fintech, an in-depth investigation of fintech continuance intentions is required."
2020-0011,3,"to investigate continuous-use behavior in a fintech context, this study focuses on two relevant issues: uncertainty and information technology (it) quality."
2020-0011,4,uncertainty is more critical in fintech than in traditional e-banking transactions because fintech transactions are complicated and less predictable.
2020-0011,5,it quality is also crucial to fintech success because it plays a key role in fintech transactions.
2020-0011,6,"this study mainly explores the relationship between uncertainty and it quality, both of which significantly affect fintech continuance intentions."
2020-0011,7,"for the purpose, we integrated an it quality-based perspective with a trust-based model to investigate fintech continuance intentions."
2020-0011,8,"our results demonstrate that system quality is negatively related to perceived risk, whereas information quality is positively related to trust."
2020-0011,9,service quality is the most important quality factor for controlling uncertainty and encouraging continued use of fintech.
2020-0011,10,we found a more extended role of it in fintech than in other digital services.
2020-0011,11,"this study provides fintech providers with the practical guidance in the design and implementation of fintech innovation, thereby achieving the sustainable development of fintech."
2020-0033,0,"this study investigates the millennials and gen z perception toward fintech services, their usage intention, and their financial behavior."
2020-0033,1,the study took place in the palestinian context with a global comparison among these generations.
2020-0033,2,the authors used the questionnaire-based technique to meet the study objective.
2020-0033,3,west bank respondents were selected for this purpose.
2020-0033,4,the study instrument was distributed through different social media channels.
2020-0033,5,the findings show that reliability/trust and ease of use are the main issues in using a financial service.
2020-0033,6,"millennials are more aware (48%) of fintech services than gen z (38%), which is different from the global view where gen z is the highest."
2020-0033,7,"the smartphone penetration rate is 100% among both generations, while the financial inclusion ratio in palestine is around 36.4%."
2020-0033,8,"these clear indicators are the main fintech drivers to promote fintech services in palestine, and these are global indicators for fintech adoption intention."
2020-0033,9,"both generations (84%) intend to use e-wallet services, millennials (87%) and gen z is (70%) prefer using real-time services."
2020-0033,10,half of the respondents see that fintech plays a complementary role with banks.
2020-0033,11,the majority see that fintech services are cheaper than bank services.
2020-0033,12,"wealth management, and robot advisor services, and both generations are looking to acquire them in the long run."
2020-0033,13,"the authors revealed that 85% of respondents from both generations trust banks, so it is recommended that banks digitize their financial services to meet the customers' needs, considering that 90% of respondents see that promotions are a key issue in adopting fintech services."
2020-0033,14,promoting e-wallet services by banks is highly recommended due to the massive rivalry with fintech parties.
2020-0039,0,we perform a large scale analysis of a list of fintech terms in (i) news and blogs in the english language and (ii) professional descriptions of companies operating in many countries.
2020-0039,1,the occurrence and the co-occurrence of fintech terms and locutions show a progressive evolution of the list of fintech terms in a compact and coherent set of terms used worldwide to describe fintech business activities.
2020-0039,2,"by using methods of complex networks that are specifically designed to deal with heterogeneous systems, our analysis of a large set of professional descriptions of companies shows that companies having fintech terms in their description present over-expressions of specific attributes of country, municipality, and economic sector."
2020-0039,3,"by using the approach of statistically validated networks, we detect geographical and economic over-expressions of a set of companies related to the multi-industry, geographically, and economically distributed fintech movement."
2020-0054,0,this paper draws on recent international experiences in modernising legal and regulatory frameworks for payment services.
2020-0054,1,it proposes an analytical framework based on a four-step process: (1) identifying payment activities.
2020-0054,2,(2) licensing entities and designating systems.
2020-0054,3,"(3) analysing and managing risks, and (4) promoting legal certainty."
2020-0054,4,"the paper concludes that as payment activities evolve and potential systemic risks heighten, adherence to international standards and additional regulatory requirements are warranted."
2020-0003,0,"as the fintech industry grows around the world, regulatory issues continue to be a hot topic within the industry."
2020-0003,1,"to overcome regulatory barriers of the fintech industry, regulatory sandboxes have been adopted."
2020-0003,2,"the regulatory sandboxes are beneficial to create a fintech ecosystem, but their effectiveness has not been empirically supported."
2020-0003,3,this study aims to find the expected effects of regulatory sandboxes on fintech venture investments empirically.
2020-0003,4,we conducted an analysis using a country-level comparative research method.
2020-0003,5,"to analyze it, we selected nine forerunning countries which have initially adopted regulatory sandboxes."
2020-0003,6,"for the purpose of validations, a comparative analysis and a regression analysis were conducted."
2020-0003,7,"in the results, we found that the adoption of regulatory sandboxes had very positive influences on the growth of the fintech venture investment."
2020-0003,8,the results implied that regulatory sandboxes may play a vital role in increasing the influx of venture capital into the fintech venture ecosystem by removing regulatory uncertainty.
2020-0003,9,the findings of this research contribute to providing the empirical evidences to policy makers in interpretations of the positive impact of regulatory sandboxes.
2020-0034,0,"purpose: this paper aims to explore the functionality of long tail markets (ltm), where the consumers cannot be reached or are ignored by the traditional mainstream businesses, in new products and business development."
2020-0034,1,"design/methodology/approach: first, the authors review two chinese entrepreneurial practices in the fintech sector and low-speed electric vehicles (lsev) and describe their stylized facts."
2020-0034,2,"second, they explore a possible theoretical ltm framework to underscore these practices."
2020-0034,3,"third, they make a connection between ltm and existing business models and analyze its significance and practical implications in business, in particular, in developing economies."
2020-0034,4,findings: the ltm business approach has helped chinese companies in the fintech sector and lsevs gain global attention.
2020-0034,5,"the success factors of ltm for businesses are identifying a specific customer base, being aware of localization products and playing skillfully with regulations."
2020-0034,6,the ltm approach has several overlaps with existing studies on niche products and base of the pyramid market.
2020-0034,7,"originality/value: based on some emerging and attractive business practices in china, this paper offers a valuable attempt to theorize them as long tail phenomenon."
2020-0034,8,the ltm thesis provides a potential framework to reference for similar methods elsewhere and may illuminate entrepreneurship to be explored in similar markets.
2020-0008,0,purpose: the purpose of this study is to explore how african fintech firms adapt their marketing strategies for successful market expansion into new african countries.
2020-0008,1,design/methodology/approach: this exploratory study is qualitative in nature and utilizes semi-structured interviews at 14 african fintech firms.

2020-0055,7,the result obtained on this research is a mobile androide application that can display fintech and promo information.
2020-0055,8,lean ux development is done with 2 iterations and produces features that are validly needed by the user but still need development in terms of user experience.
2020-0021,0,since the last global financial crisis supervisory mechanisms and regulations have become more stringent which have significantly improved resilience of banks therefore positively affecting financial stability.
2020-0021,1,apart from traditional financial institutions which have been supervised according to strict regulations and standards technological development in financial services commonly called fintech have introduced new trends providing fast peer to peer lending which directly matches lenders and borrowers thus putting more pressure to policymakers and supervisors.
2020-0021,2,"this paper presents potential implications of fintech developments to financial stability, while explaining fintech influence to market structure as well as benefits and risks of technologically driven financial innovations to financial stability."
2020-0021,3,the paper stresses out an importance of international cooperation of regulators in order to preserve financial stability in the recent world of technological changes and innovations.
2020-0021,4,fintech has changed consumers' expectations and preferences while increasing the number of users expecting fast and easily accessible services available on mobile phones and other electronic devices.
2020-0021,5,the paper shows that new technology provides the space for expanding financial services but it also poses additional risks to financial system in terms of microfinancial and macrofinancial risks.
2020-0014,0,"in this article, we provide a taxonomy of the different types of innovation occurring in financial services, a framework which we refer to as our fintech ecosystem."
2020-0014,1,we use this fintech ecosystem to highlight the various areas of potential value for investors who are looking into ventures in this space as alternative investments.
2020-0014,2,our conceptual framework enables investors to examine emerging technologies and fintech verticals through the lens of a sector analysis.
2020-0014,3,"to better understand where the fintech revolution started and where it is going, we apply the concept of digital transformation to the financial services industry which allows us to highlight the delicate risk-reward balance in fintech."
2020-0005,0,"the paper proposes an explainable ai model that can be used in fintech risk management and, in particular, in measuring the risks that arise when credit is borrowed employing peer to peer lending platforms."
2020-0005,1,"the model employs shapley values, so that ai predictions are interpreted according to the underlying explanatory variables."
2020-0005,2,"the empirical analysis of 15,000 small and medium companies asking for peer to peer lending credit reveals that both risky and not risky borrowers can be grouped according to a set of similar financial characteristics, which can be employed to explain and understand their credit score and, therefore, to predict their future behavior."
2020-0035,0,"driving force of human society development is elimination contradiction between unlimited usage of natural resources during economic activity of enterprises, environment pollution as a result of such activity and limited natural, energy and other resources."
2020-0035,1,research results on economic and environmental issues of green business management showed that there are several basic types of problems at present which arise at enterprises during collecting and processing data on the results of their activities.

2020-0035,5,"application of fintech, methods of processing large data sets and tools for implementing the principles of greening the economy will enable to increase the investment attractiveness of green business and will simplify the interaction between the state and enterprises."
2020-0041,0,the modern world is changing rapidly under the influence of digital technologies.
2020-0041,1,this also applies to the financial sector of the economy.
2020-0041,2,"since the mid-2000s, new fintech companies have entered the market."
2020-0041,3,these companies are using new technologies to improve existing and create new financial services.
2020-0041,4,"in the course of their development, the interests of new market entrants often overlap with those of traditional participants, mainly banks."
2020-0041,5,investigation of the relations between fintech companies and traditional financial institutions gives an opportunity to form an idea of the financial picture of the near future.
2020-0041,6,the research of the relations between fintech companies and traditional financial institutions gives an opportunity to form an idea of the financial picture of the near future.
2020-0041,7,the article considers both aspects of competition and aspects of possible cooperation between financial market participants in a digital economy.
2020-0041,8,the results of the scientific research demonstrate that cooperation will prevail over the competition.
2020-0041,9,probably existing financial institutions will reformat their architecture and become digital ones at the core.
2020-0007,0,"a growing body of evidence suggests that financial literacy plays an important role in financial well-being, and that differences in financial knowledge acquired early in life can explain a significant part of financial and more general well-being in adult life."
2020-0007,1,financial technology (fintech) is revolutionising the financial services industry at an unrivalled pace.
2020-0007,2,"views differ regarding the likely impact that fintech is likely to have on personal financial planning, well-being and societal welfare."
2020-0007,3,"in an era of mounting student debt, increased (digital) financial inclusion, and threats arising from instances of (online) financial fraud, financial education and enlightened financial advising appropriate policy interventions that enhance financial and overall well-being."
2020-0007,4,this special issue engages in this important academic and policy agenda by presenting a set of seven new papers emanating from four parallel streams of literature related to financial literacy and responsible finance.
2020-0029,0,this article examines fintech as a systemic force disrupting the currently dominant technocratic paradigm of financial regulation.
2020-0029,1,"it offers a five-part taxonomy of (i) the key fintech-driven changes in the structure and operation of today's financial system, and (ii) the corresponding challenges these systemic shifts pose to the continuing efficacy of the regulatory enterprise as it exists today."
2020-0029,2,this exercise reveals the fundamental tension at the core of the fintech problem.
2020-0029,3,"in the fintech era, the financial system as a whole is growing ever bigger, moving ever faster, and getting ever more complex and difficult to manage."
2020-0029,4,"the emerging regulatory responses to these macro-level changes, however, continue to operate primarily on the micro-level."
2020-0029,5,"surveying the presently fragmented efforts to regulate fintech, this article highlights the limiting effects of the technocratic bias built into their design."
2020-0029,6,"against that background, it outlines several alternative reform options that would explicitly target the core macro-structural, as opposed to micro-transactional, aspects of the fintech challenge- a nd do so in a more assertive, comprehensive, and normatively unified manner."
2020-0020,0,the digitalization of financial services opened a window for new players in the financial industry.
2020-0020,1,"these start-ups take on tasks and functions previously reserved for banks, such as financing, asset management, and payments."
2020-0020,2,"in this article, we trace the transformation of the industry after digitalization."
2020-0020,3,"by using data on fintech formations in germany, we provide first evidence that entrepreneurial dynamics in the fintech sector are not so much driven by technology as by the educational and business background of the founders."
2020-0020,4,"furthermore, we investigate the reactions of traditional banks to the emergence of these start-ups."
2020-0020,5,"in contrast with other emerging industries such as biotechnology, a network analysis shows that fintechs have mostly engaged in strategic partnerships and only a few banks have acquired or obtained a financial interest in a fintech."
2020-0020,6,we explain the restraint of traditional banks to fully endorse the new possibilities of digitalized financial services with the characteristics of the technology itself and with the postponed fundamental decisions of banks to modernize their it infrastructure.
2020-0000,0,"we argue financial technology (fintech) is the key driver for financial inclusion, which in turn underlies sustainable balanced development, as embodied in the un sustainable development goals (sdgs)."
2020-0000,1,the full potential of fintech to support the sdgs may be realized with a progressive approach to the development of underlying infrastructure to support digital financial transformation.
2020-0000,2,our research suggests that the best way to think about such a strategy is to focus on four primary pillars.
2020-0000,3,"the first pillar requires the building of digital identity, simplified account opening and e-kyc systems, supported by the second pillar of open interoperable electronic payments systems."
2020-0000,4,the third pillar involves using the infrastructure of the first and second pillars to underpin electronic provision of government services and payments.
2020-0000,5,the fourth pillardesign of digital financial markets and systemssupports broader access to finance and investment.
2020-0000,6,"implementing the four pillars is a major journey for any economy, but one which has tremendous potential to transform not only finance but economies and societies, through fintech, financial inclusion and sustainable balanced development."

2020-0023,1,"the study is motivated by endogenous growth theory, which seeks to explain technology as the most important driver of economic growth."
2020-0023,2,the study finds that fintech startups are positively correlated with indonesias economic growth.
2020-0023,3,"fintech firms in their first year are found to be disruptive, but they fail to have serious consequences on indonesias economic growth."
2020-0023,4,"however, they seem to significantly encourage economic growth in their second year."
2020-0023,5,"these findings are derived after accounting for other important growth determinants, namely, capital per labor, foreign direct investment (fdi), stock market development, and trade openness."
2020-0056,0,"micro, small, and medium enterprises (msmes) are increasingly growing with the development of technology, where msmes are one of the pillars of the strength of the indonesian economy."
2020-0056,1,"fintech is one of the drivers in helping to improve finance for msmes, especially those in the middle and lower classes."
2020-0056,2,"at least more than 40 fintech businesses have emerged throughout 2017. by utilizing the development of fintech, in addition to increasing efficiency in the financial sector also minimizing the risk of fraud and cybercrime in the financial sector."
2020-0056,3,"for this reason, it is necessary to increase knowledge to msmes regarding the benefits of using fintech, so that the level of trust in msmes towards fintech is increasing, and the use of fintech is every day."

2020-0057,0,"as a new fintech innovation regulation tool, regulatory sandbox effectively balances financial innovation and risk, so it is adopted by many regulatory authorities around the world."
2020-0057,1,"however, until now, regulatory sandbox is still at the stage of manually submitting data, and artificial intelligence has not been applied to it."
2020-0057,2,"hence, in this paper, we propose the framework of parallel fintech regulatory sandbox based on the acp approach (artificial systems + computational experiments + parallel execution)."
2020-0057,3,"then, we talk about how to combine the emerging blockchain technology with intelligent regulatory sandbox, thus solving problems such as poor data flow and regulation sluggish."
2020-0057,4,this paper is aimed at providing helpful guidance and reference for the development of fintech regulatory sandbox.
2020-0058,0,the level of financial literacy of rural residents will affect their financial decisions and the financial well-being behind the decisions.
2020-0058,1,this paper uses mediating effect and moderating effect to test the influence path of rural residents' subjective and objective financial literacy on their financial decision-making with survey data from henan and anhui provinces in china.
2020-0058,2,the results show that subjective and objective financial literacy have positive effects on financial market participation.
2020-0058,3,subjective and objective financial literacy have negative direct effects on insurance market participation.
2020-0058,4,subjective financial literacy plays an incomplete mediating effect in the impact of objective financial literacy on financial market and insurance market participation.
2020-0058,5,objective financial literacy is adjusted by subjective financial literacy on financial market participation and insurance market participation.
2020-0058,6,"at the same time, we introduce financial technology penetration as a threshold variable in the model and find that the financial literacy has stronger impact on financial decision-making if the financial technology penetration is above the threshold."
2020-0027,0,the green development level reflected in the green finance index and the evaluation of the degree of green development in smart cities have important practical effects on economic transformation.
2020-0027,1,"for promoting the transformation and upgrading of finance, we select 2013-2019 data and construct a distributed lag model to analyse the important role played by green finance and financial technology in the construction of smart cities."
2020-0027,2,"in the paper, we find green finance promotes the construction of smart cities, and only it will not appear until nine months late."
2020-0027,3,"financial technology has an opposite impact on the construction of smart cities, this is mainly because the research and marketization of financial technology are higher, and the cost is also higher."
2020-0027,4,this influence will appear in the next 14 months.
2020-0059,0,purpose: this paper analyzes banking sector earnings management using loan loss provisions (llps) in the fintech era.
2020-0059,1,design/methodology/approach: regression methodology was used to examine earnings management in the fintech era.
2020-0059,2,findings: the findings show evidence for bank income smoothing using llps.
2020-0059,3,"there is greater income smoothing in the second-wave fintech era compared to the first-wave fintech era, and the presence of strong institutions did not lower income smoothing in the second-wave era."
2020-0059,4,"bank income smoothing is also greater in (1) bank of international settlement (bis) and eu countries than in non-eu countries and g7 countries, (2) well-capitalized banking sectors and (3) during economic booms in the second-wave fintech era."
2020-0059,5,practical implications: the competition for loans and deposits by banks and fintech lenders in the second-wave fintech era created additional incentives for banks to engage in income smoothing to report competitive and stable earnings.
2020-0059,6,originality/value: the study uses a unique approach to detect country-level earnings management in the banking sector.
2020-0059,7,"also, this study extends the bank earnings management literature by introducing the fintech era as a determinant of the extent of bank earnings management."
2020-0017,0,"the article considers the opportunities, risks, and challenges associated with the development of digital financial technologies."
2020-0017,1,"to identify them, we used the scenario approach."
2020-0017,2,"we determined three main development scenarios for the market of innovative financial technologies  domination of traditional financial companies, segmentation of market of new financial technologies, and domination of digital financial companies in terms of their probability and possible consequences for the global financial markets."
2020-0017,3,"the results of analysis allowed us to suggest that among main scenarios of fintech development the most probable is the splitting of existing market, which in the future can turn into a market of digital transnational financial corporations, which will squeeze out both small companies and traditional financial giants."
2020-0017,4,"however, although the scenario of capturing the financial market by large players is currently unlikely, it is certainly more important in terms of the consequences for global markets."
2020-0017,5,the main prerequisite for the latter scenario is the promotion of international cooperation in the regulation of digital financial companies.
2020-0017,6,such a condition requires new models of country-level interaction in the regulation of innovative financial companies in order to address the risks and challenges of different scenarios of fintech development on global financial markets.
2020-0017,7,"this article includes a comparative analysis of digital development in russia and the republic of korea, which is one of the key players on the asian fintech market, as a possible benchmark that can be used to shape the policies of intergovernmental cooperation on global financial markets."
2020-0017,8,these policies include 1) regulatory cooperation that reduces risks due to growing experience in the regulation of innovative financial companies.
2020-0017,9,"2)cooperation in investments that allow one to acquire additional experience in regulatory practices and to develop infrastructure, which meets the new requirements of digital finance."
2020-0017,10,and 3) cooperation in the taxation of fintech companies that reduces cross-border regulatory arbitrage.
2020-0028,0,"the rapid increase in the number of fintech companies in indonesia in the past three years has attracted the attention of many stakeholders, including the government, investors, conventional bank management, and even the general public."
2020-0028,1,the phenomenon of the development of peer-to-peer lending fintech companies in indonesia is supported by the increasing demand of consumers.
2020-0028,2,"the research objective is to provide insight into the determinants of consumer interest in using fintech applications, using the technology acceptance model by added e-trust variables ."
2020-0028,3,the data analysis method used structural equation modeling with warppls 6.0 software.
2020-0028,4,"questionnaires were distributed to fintech consumers in indonesia, with a total sample of 379 respondents."
2020-0028,5,"the results of this study indicate that the dimensions of e-trust contribute to determining the perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude to adopt peer-to-peer lending fintech services, and intention to use peer-to-peer lending applications."
2020-0044,0,the popularity and potential of fintech for generating business value has been highlighted in an evolving number of studies.
2020-0044,1,"nevertheless, there is still ambiguity on the success of such disruptive technologies."
2020-0044,2,"to address this gap, this paper draws on a case study of an it vendor in japan."
2020-0044,3,"we interview key stakeholders involved in the case project to (i) explore the success factors of fintech applications adopted by non-financial organisations, (ii) illustrate the applicability of the multi-dimensional project success framework in fintech projects, and (iii) highlight the importance of the fintech project management field that warrants further investigation."
2020-0044,4,"we contribute to the it project management field, where we extend the theoretical background with aspects of fintech adoption and success."
2020-0044,5,we also inform practice in terms of lessons for managers to improve the existing processes and assist their organisations in business transformational initiatives using fintech.
2020-0036,0,what has boosted crowdfundings growth?
2020-0036,1,"in the case of peer-to-peer (p2p) lending, we highlight the role of consumers distrust in banks."
2020-0036,2,we offer evidence that distrust in banks likely triggers individuals to supply funding toward crowdfunding and away from bank deposits.
2020-0036,3,"we highlight that a distrust mindset promotes questioning default choices and considering alternatives, and fosters comparisons focusing on dissimilarities."
2020-0036,4,"our findings suggest us states whose residents express greater distrust in banks are more likely to fund p2p loans and, conditional on funding, lend higher amounts."
2020-0036,5,this relationship is more pronounced when funding small loans or borrowers with less banking access.
2020-0046,0,aim/purpose this study aimed to examine the effect of marketing knowledge management (mkm) on bank performance via the mediating role of the fintech innovation in jordanian commercial banks.
2020-0046,1,"background an extensive number of studies found a significant relationship between marketing knowledge management and bank performance (e.g., akroush & al-mohammad, 2010. hou & chien 2010. rezaee & jafari, 2015. veismoradi et al., 2013)."
2020-0046,2,"however, there remains a lack of clarity regarding the relationship between marketing knowledge management (mkm) and bank performance (bp)."
2020-0046,3,"furthermore, the linkage between mkm and bp is not straightforward but, instead, includes a more complicated relationship."
2020-0046,4,"therefore, it is argued that managing marketing knowledge management assets and capabilities can enhance performance via the role of financial innovation as a mediating factor on commercial banks."
2020-0046,5,"to date, however, there is no empirical evidence."
2020-0046,6,"methodology based on a literature review, knowledge-based theory, and financial innovation theory, an integrated conceptual framework has been developed to guide the study."
2020-0046,7,"a quantitative approach was used, and the data was collected from 336 managers and employees in all 13 jordanian commercial banks using online and in hand instruments."
2020-0046,8,structural equation modeling (sem) was used to analyze and verify the study variables.
2020-0046,9,contribution this article contributes to theory by filling a gap in the literature regarding the role of marketing knowledge management assets and capabilities in commercial banks operating in a developing country like jordan.
2020-0046,10,it empirically examined and validated the role of fintech innovation as mediators between marketing knowledge management and bank performance findings the main findings revealed that marketing knowledge management had a significant favorable influence on bank performance.
2020-0046,11,fintech innovation acted as partial mediators in this relationship.
2020-0046,12,recommendations commercial banks should be fully aware of the importance of knowledge man-for practitioners agement practices to enhance their financial innovation and bank performance.
2020-0046,13,they should also consider promoting a culture of practicing knowledge management processes among their managers and employees by motivating and training to promote innovations.
2020-0046,14,"recommendations the result endorsed fintech innovation's mediating effect on the relationship for researchers between the independent variable, marketing knowledge management (assets and capabilities), and the dependent variable bank performance, which was not addressed before."
2020-0046,15,"thus, it needs further validation."
2020-0046,16,"future research the current designed research model can be applied and assessed further in other sectors, including banking and industrial sectors across developed and developing countries."
2020-0046,17,"it would also be of interest to introduce other variables in the study model that can act as consequences of mkm capabilities, such as financial and non-financial performance measures."

2020-0045,0,this article examines potential consumer harm that may arise due to regulating modern financial services communication technology with rules written in the early 20th century.
2020-0045,1,"it is argued that disparities in record keeping regulation across communication mediums disincentivizes the use of technology capable of generating records for consumer retention, while incentivizing the use of technology which shields financial advisors from accountability."
2020-0045,2,experimental evidence is provided in support of this argument.
2020-0045,3,"further, it is argued that regulation disparities across communication mediums may result in more wrongful accusations of advisor misconduct, less reporting of genuine misconduct, less self-policing among industry members, and greater unrectifiable consumer harm."
2020-0045,4,"objections to these arguments are considered, along with practical guidance for consumers, regulators, and policy makers."
2020-0004,0,"although theory suggests that financial market imperfectionsmainly information asymmetries, market segmentation and transaction costsprevent poor people from escaping poverty by limiting their access to formal financial services, new financial technologies (fintech) are seen as key enablers of financial inclusion."
2020-0004,1,"indeed, the un 2030 agenda for sustainable development (un-2030-asd) and the g20 high-level principles for digital financial inclusion (g20-hlp-dfi) highlight the importance of harnessing the potential of fintech to reduce financial exclusion and income inequality."
2020-0004,2,"this paper investigates the interrelationship between fintech, financial inclusion and income inequality for a panel of 140 countries using the global findex waves of survey data for 2011, 2014 and 2017. we posit that fintech affects inequality directly and indirectly through financial inclusion."
2020-0004,3,we invoke quantile regression analysis to investigate whether such effects differ across countries with different levels of income inequality.
2020-0004,4,we uncover new evidence that financial inclusion is a key channel through which fintech reduces income inequality.
2020-0004,5,"we also find that while financial inclusion significantly reduces inequality at all quantiles of the inequality distribution, these effects are primarily associated with higher-income countries."
2020-0004,6,"overall, our results support the aspirations of the un-2030-asd and g20-hlp-dfi."
2020-0004,7,highlights harnessing the potential of fintech to reduce financial exclusion and income inequality has been proposed by the un and g20.
2020-0004,8,we posit that fintech affects income inequality directly and indirectly through financial inclusion.
2020-0004,9,we invoke quantile regression analysis to investigate whether the effects of fintech differ across countries with different levels of income inequality.
2020-0004,10,"we find that financial inclusion is a key channel through which fintech reduces income inequality, at all quantile levels, primarily among higher-income countries."
2020-0022,0,"we investigate how the emergence of fintech start-ups and their financing is shaped by regional knowledge creation and lack of trust in financial services incumbents across 21 oecd countries, 226 regions and over the 20072014 period."
2020-0022,1,we find that knowledge generated in the it sector is much more salient for fostering new fintech start-ups than knowledge generated in the financial services sector.
2020-0022,2,"additionally, the importance of new knowledge created in the financial services sector (it sector) increases (decreases) as fintech start-ups grow and seek financing."
2020-0022,3,"when the level of trust in financial services incumbents falls within a region, this is followed by an increase in the financing provided to fintech start-ups."
2020-0022,4,"nevertheless, regions with historically low average levels of trust in financial services incumbents attract less fintech investment overall."
2020-0030,0,"inexperienced individual investors are the main players in the emerging fintech industry, and also suffer from frequent negative events in the markets."
2020-0030,1,"with 3,110 negative events and 467,594 transaction data of chinas peer-to-peer lending market from 2015 to 2018, this paper analyzes how different types of platform negative events affect the decision-making of individual investors."
2020-0030,2,"we find that individual investors only have a significant negative reaction to moral hazard exposure events such as platforms absconding, with relatively ignorance of other types of negative events."
2020-0030,3,"the negative effect is rapid but short-lived, and shows differences among platforms of different background and attributes."
2020-0030,4,"by the mediation analysis, we find that public attention can be a mediator and explain the pattern of the impact that absconding events have on individual investors."
2020-0030,5,"related risk prevention, regulation, investor education issues are discussed and further suggestions are also put forward for both individual investors and regulators."
2020-0002,0,pursose: the ongoing corona virus (covid 19) pandemic has already impacted almost everyone across the globe.
2020-0002,1,the focus has now shifted from spread of the disease to the economic consequences it will bring to the society.
2020-0002,2,the shortage of production will result into the shortage of supply and consequently will end as loss of jobs and employment for millions of people around the world.
2020-0002,3,"two of the most important section of our society i.e., daily wage laborers and small and medium enterprises (smes) will have to bear the major burnt of this crisis."
2020-0002,4,the proposed integrated artificial intelligence and nlp based islamic fintech model combining zakat (islamic tax) and qardh-al-hasan (benevolent loan) can help the economy to minimize the adverse impact of covid 19 on individuals and smes.
2020-0002,5,design/methodology/approach: the present study explores the possibility of zakat and qardh-al-hasan as a financing method to fight the adverse impact of corona virus on poor individuls and smes.
2020-0002,6,it provides the solution by proposing an artificial intelligence and nlp based islamic fintech model combining zakat and qardh-al-hasan.
2020-0002,7,findings: the findings of the study reveals that islamic finance has immense potential to fight any kind of situation/pandemic.
2020-0002,8,"zakat and qardh-al-hasan, if combined together can prove to be a deadly combination to fight the adverse effect of covid 19. practical implications: to be used as an effective way to support individuals and smes in the period during and after the pandemic of covid 19. originality/value: there is no study combining zakat and qardh al-hasan to fight the adverse effect of poor individuals and smes."
2020-0002,9,the study will contribute massively to the existing literature and will help the government and civil societies in fighting the economic impact of covid 19 on individuals and smes.
2020-0043,0,"fintech is an active area of innovation and a rapidly growing sector of the economy, yet relatively little is known about how information technology contributes to innovation in fintech."
2020-0043,1,we draw on the business model canvas framework and we examine the role of information technology in the business models of leading fintech startups in the new york city fintech ecosystem.
2020-0043,2,"we find that information technology plays a key role across nearly all components of the business models, orchestrating resources and processes to efficiently deliver personalized financial services to customers."
2020-0043,3,"focusing on the it-enabled value propositions across the fintech startups in our sample, we find that the startups tend to emphasize low-cost offerings that may pose a threat to incumbent business models in financial services."
2020-0001,0,purpose: the paper aims to review the academic research work done in the area of islamic financial technology.
2020-0001,1,"the islamic fintech area has been classified into three broad categories of the islamic fintech, islamic financial technology opportunities and challenges, cryptocurrency/blockchain sharia compliance and law/regulation."
2020-0001,2,"finally, the study identifies and highlights the opportunities and challenges that islamic financial institutions can learn from the conventional fintech organization across the world."
2020-0001,3,"approach/methodology/design: the study collected 133 research studies (50 from social science research network (ssrn), 30 from research gate, 33 from google scholar and 20 from other sources) in the area of islamic financial technology."
2020-0001,4,the study presents the systematic review of the above studies.
2020-0001,5,"findings: the study classifies the islamic fintech into three broad categories namely, islamic fintech opportunities and challenges, cryptocurrency/blockchain sharia compliance and law/regulation."
2020-0001,6,the study identifies that the sharia compliance related to the cryptocurrency/blockchain is the biggest challenge which islamic fintech organizations are facing.
2020-0001,7,during our review we also find that islamic fintech organizations are to be considered as partners by the islamic financial institutions (ifi's) than the competitors.
2020-0001,8,"if islamic financial institutions want to increase efficiency, transparency and customer satisfaction they have to adopt fintech and become partners with the fintech companies."
2020-0001,9,"practical implications: the study will contribute positively to the understanding of islamic fintech for the academia, industry, regulators, investors and other fintech users."
2020-0001,10,originality/value: the study believes to contribute positively to understanding of fintech based technology like cryptocurrency/blockchain from sharia perspective.
2020-0037,0,purpose: the aim of the paper is to develop the approach to a legal definition of fintech.
2020-0037,1,"design/methodology/approach: in this paper we evolve possible approaches of fintech legal definition, investigate existing approaches at the international level and examine the policies applied at the national levels."
2020-0037,2,"document analysis, as a form of qualitative research, was used in this study."
2020-0037,3,"findings: we found that in most countries the legislation does not specifically address fintech companies, and the legal framework equally regulates the activities of traditional service providers and fintech operators."
2020-0037,4,"in our opinion, no specific legislation for fintech companies needed, each type of activity provided by a financial or technology company is subject to a specific legislation/regulation with primary focus on services and products provided as payments, insurance, investments etc."
2020-0037,5,"practical implications: the term fintech is freely used by policy makers, regulators, companies, researchers, academics and the public, both nationally and internationally."
2020-0037,6,"according to international organizations such as the imf, the world bank and the oecd, fintech offers the opportunity to accelerate economic growth and expand financial affordability/inclusion in all countries."
2020-0037,7,some countries are increasingly striving to become global or international regional hubs for fintech and are working hard to develop interagency government strategies with a supportive legal environment.
2020-0037,8,"originality/value: there is still confusion about the nature and dynamics of fintech among politicians, scientists and practitioners, as well as about the legal framework of this area."
2020-0037,9,the value of this article is to clarify and propose an apprach to definition of fintech by combining different approaches in a very original and innovative way.
2020-0042,0,"currently, lending fintech is proliferating."
2020-0042,1,it is because of the high financing needs of the people who have not been reached by the banks.
2020-0042,2,the existence of lending fintech is getting stronger with the issuance of the financial service authority regulation number 77 of 2018 concerning information technology-based money lending and borrowing services.
2020-0042,3,"until august 2019, there were 127 lending fintech registered in the financial service authority."
2020-0042,4,"unfortunately, there is still a problem concerning protecting consumers who make loan transactions with fintech companies, along with the rise of illegal fintech companies."
2020-0042,5,"therefore, this paper tries to analyze the potential development of lending fintech in indonesia, along with its opportunities and challenges."
2020-0042,6,the study of this research uses normative juridical.
2020-0042,7,this paper concludes that the current regulation is still not enough in providing legal protection to consumers in conducting the transaction in lending fintech.
2020-0042,8,"therefore, it is necessary to make a comprehensive regulation that regulates this so that public trust in the lending fintech company is higher."
2020-0060,0,"agriculture is the primary occupation and the backbone of the indian economy as per the report of ficci, over 70 percent of the population in india depends on agriculture."
2020-0060,1,"indian government has been trying hard to provide financial services to the people who don't have access to these services through 'digital drive-, which was partially successful."
2020-0060,2,but still large number of rural people especially farmers depends on traditional credit system.
2020-0060,3,presently to support farmer technologically agri- tech is providing services.
2020-0060,4,"fin-tech provides financial service to all the sectors, but there is no impact on farming sector for providing credit facilities."
2020-0060,5,so the farmers are more dependent on the private lenders for loans with high interest rates for their farming needs.
2020-0060,6,but due to this repayment of loan with high interest has become huge burden and is leading to suicides and deaths.
2020-0060,7,the aim of the paper is to analyze the fin- tech in agri sector and its impact in helping the farmers to fulfill their needs to lesser their burdens.
2020-0060,8,this helps farmers to overcome the situations and sustain to the changes in the market.
2020-0015,0,financial technology (fintech) has attracted a wide range of attention and is rapidly proliferating.
2020-0015,1,as a result of its consistent growth new terms have been introduced in this domain.
2020-0015,2,the term 'fintech' is one such terminology.
2020-0015,3,this term is used for describing various operations that are being frequently employed in the financial technology sector.
2020-0015,4,these operations are usually practiced in enterprises or organizations and provide requested services by using information technology based applications.
2020-0015,5,"the term does take into account various other sensitive issues, like, security, privacy, threats, cyber-attacks, etc."
2020-0015,6,"this is important to note that the development of fintech is indebted to the mutual integration of different state of the art technologies, for example, technologies related to a mobile embedded system, mobile networks, mobile cloud computing, big data, data analytics techniques, and cloud computing etc."
2020-0015,7,"however, this technology is facing several security and privacy issues that are much needed to be addressed in order to improve the acceptability of this new technology among its users."
2020-0015,8,"in an effort to secure fintech, this article provides a comprehensive survey of fintech by reviewing the most recent as well as anticipated financial industry privacy and security issues."
2020-0015,9,"it provides a comprehensive analysis of current security issues, detection mechanisms and security solutions proposed for fintech."
2020-0015,10,"finally, it discusses future challenges to ensure the security and privacy of financial technology applications."
2020-0061,0,"although interest in fintech businesses has been growing, research about these companies is still scarce."
2020-0061,1,"to address this gap, this paper aims to understand the evolution of the fintechs ecosystem, through a socio-technical system theory and service innovation lense."
2020-0061,2,"a case study research methodology was used, in which 6 brazilian and 5 portuguese fintechs were analyzed."
2020-0061,3,"primary data was collected using semi-structured interviews with managers and employees of the startups, while secondary data was obtained through the analysis of reports from consulting firms and public relations materials of the startups."
2020-0061,4,results show the evolution of fintech ecosystems from the perspective of socio-technical system theory and service innovation.
2020-0061,5,"from the socio-technical system perspective it was possible to understand the roles of social, technological and organizational actors in the evolution of these ecosystems."
2020-0061,6,"from the service innovation perspective, it was possible to understand the dynamics of the evolution of the fintech ecosystems and its results."
2019-0024,0,"this paper explores the possibility of using big data and fintech tools to comply with the duties of advice and adequacy, typical of the model of the ""responsible loans"", as mechanisms to avoid excessive debt or alleviate it once evidenced."
2019-0024,1,"with these alternatives of information processing, certain problems in the dynamics of the protective regulation for the financial consumer can be solved, such as the deficiencies in the configuration of models of information recipients (the ""average consumer""), the overcoming of the duties of information and its necessary reformulation as duties of advice or warning and the promotion of the renegotiation of the debt for its adjustment to the real possibilities of payment of the debtor."
2019-0032,0,"in society 5.0, financial capital is no longer the key, but data that are interconnected with each other."
2019-0032,1,"the internet of things will be a new normal, dedicated to unlocking human potentials."
2019-0032,2,the purpose of this study is to analyze the feasibilities and challenges of the implementation of fintech in small and medium industries.
2019-0032,3,"to this end, a survey was conducted on a sample of 60 small and medium industries."
2019-0032,4,"it was revealed that the implementation of fintech in small and medium industries did not seem ready to be achieved due to the limitations in technology infrastructure, data and information, human resources and policy."
2019-0032,5,"therefore, improvement to these factors should be made to realize the human-centered and technology-based society."
2019-0007,0,transformation of agribusiness is critical in light of the agenda for sustainable development.
2019-0007,1,"fintech and the integration of fintech with other (green) technologies as well as with digitized agriculture plays an important role when it comes to, for example, sdg 12, specifically, responsible production, as it can mitigate trade-offs and enhance synergies between environmental and social sdgs, for example, 1 and 15, increasing profitability without additional use of natural resources."
2019-0007,2,"important limitations and risks need to be addressed, however, for developing countries to fully benefit from the potential that fintech holds in this context."
2019-0007,3,mitigating factors include massive infrastructure investments and large-scale capacity building.
2019-0007,4,rigorous research on economic sustainability and cost-effectiveness of newer fintech models is needed to make sound policy recommendations.
2019-0013,0,"with the rapid development of information technology (it) in financial industry, financial technology (fintech) has become an emerging area for enterprises and organizations."
2019-0013,1,"due to the wide adoption of it, various fintech applications are used by financial industry to help process information and offer financial services."
2019-0013,2,"traditionally, textual passwords are the most widely deployed authentication mechanism, while having many known limitations."
2019-0013,3,"as a result, there is a need to enhance the security of fintech authentication against cyber-criminals."
2019-0013,4,"as an alternative, graphical passwords (gps) are considered as one promising solution to complement traditional password-based systems."
2019-0013,5,"in the literature, various gp schemes were proposed such as passpoints, das, cued click points, geopass, etc."
2019-0013,6,"in this work, we identify that multiple password inference has become a challenge for most gp schemes, and thus design routemap, a map-and route-based gp to further improve the security of fintech applications."
2019-0013,7,this scheme requires users to create a route on a world map as their credentials.
2019-0013,8,"in the evaluation, we involved a total of 120 participants, among which 60 of them have financial (fintech) background, and investigated the performance of routemap by comparing it with two similar schemes."
2019-0013,9,our results demonstrate that participants can achieve better performance using routemap in the aspects of both authentication accuracy and multiple password memory.
2019-0013,10,our effort attempts to complement existing studies and stimulate more research on the combination of gp and fintech.
2019-0020,0,the green development of fintech empowerment has become a compelling theme in economic development.
2019-0020,1,"in this study, based on the weighted least squares (wls) and threshold regression methods of cross-sectional data, we empirically examine the impact of fintech development on agricultural nonpoint source (nps) pollution, a major cause of impaired surface water quality."
2019-0020,2,our results show that there is an inverted u shape relationship between the development of fintech and agricultural nps pollution.
2019-0020,3,"that is, after crossing a threshold value, the level of fintech development can curb agricultural nps pollution."
2019-0020,4,"at the structural level, the availability of fintech services, the fintech infrastructure, and the agricultural nps pollution also have an inverted u shape relationship."
2019-0020,5,"at the threshold effect, in the developing stage of an agricultural economy, the overall level of fintech development, the use of fintech services, the availability of fintech services, and the fintech infrastructure have an inverted u shape relationship with agricultural nps pollution."
2019-0020,6,"on the other hand, in the developed stage of an agricultural economy, the impact of fintech development and its structure on agricultural nps pollution is insignificant."
2019-0020,7,"hence, we can conclude that fintech development can help reduce agricultural nps pollution in under-developed regions."
2019-0020,8,"however, due to the fact that a u shape relationship always exists between fintech service quality and agricultural nps pollution, the quality of fintech service should be the main focus to reduce agricultural nps pollution more effectively."
2019-0012,0,"blockchain is currently one of the most important topics in both the academia and industry world, mainly due to the possible effects that the continuing application of this new technology could have."
2019-0012,1,the adoption of this technology by fintech companies constitutes the next step towards the expansion of blockchain and its sustainability.
2019-0012,2,"the paper conducts a mapping study on the research topics, limitations, gaps and future trends of blockchain in fintech companies."
2019-0012,3,a total of 49 papers from a scientific database (web of science core collection) have been analyzed.
2019-0012,4,"the results show a deep focus in challenges such as security, scalability, legal and regulatory, privacy or latency, with proposed solutions still to be far from being effective."
2019-0012,5,"a vast majority of the research is focused into finance and banking sector, obviating other industries that could play a crucial role in the further expansion of blockchain."
2019-0012,6,"this study can contribute to researchers as a starting point for their investigation, as well as a source for recommendations on future investigation directions regarding blockchain in the fintech sector."
2019-0009,0,"in the current international context, the ways in which financial technology (fintech) affects sustainable development need to be urgently identified."
2019-0009,1,"however, relevant studies are rare and there is no consensus on the optimal indicator system for sustainable development."
2019-0009,2,"therefore, this study proposes an indicator system to evaluate sustainability and conducts in-depth analysis of the relationship between fintech and sustainable development based on data of peer-to-peer platforms (p2p) in 31 chinese provinces."
2019-0009,3,"the empirical results show the existence of a u-shaped relationship between fintech and sustainable development, mainly determined by the pattern of extensive economic growth."
2019-0009,4,"furthermore, heterogeneity analysis indicates that there are significant regional differences in its impact on sustainable development, being significant in china's eastern and central regions and insignificant in the western region."
2019-0009,5,"moreover, the impact on the central region is significantly higher than that on the eastern region."
2019-0009,6,our research not only has strong practical significance but also contributes significantly to the literature on fintech and sustainable development.
2019-0025,0,"in 1971, the patent for the automated teller machine was awarded to david wetzel."
2019-0025,1,"while possibly not the first application of financial technology, since 1971 time, the innovation in the financial industry has grown beyond expectations."
2019-0025,2,"however, most studies in innovation ignore the financial sector altogether."
2019-0025,3,"in this study, the authors investigate financial technology firms and innovation."
2019-0025,4,"after identifying firms that are considered financial technology, the authors collect innovation outcomes such as patents and data breaches associated with those firms."
2019-0025,5,the authors show that patent activity has enjoyed modest growth year over year.
2019-0025,6,"however, firms still have challenges to overcome such as market risk and data security."
2019-0025,7,this study serves as a perspective on financial technology.
2019-0034,0,"the goal of this study is to investigate whether fintech e-payment affects economic development in apec countries, in particular, income growth, productivity, price volatility, and income inequality."
2019-0034,1,we use e-payment index introduced by rmit university and trpc and apply quantile regression with gme approach.
2019-0034,2,"we consider the quantile level at 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75. at the low level of economic development variables, the fintech have the highest effects on these variables compared with the medium and high level of economic development."
2019-0034,3,"in other words, fintech supports not only low level of growth and productivity but also reduce the low level of price volatility and income inequity."
2019-0034,4,"further investigation provides that e-payment usage and technology empowerment are helpful to economic development, particularly, increasing in growth and productivity."
2019-0035,0,the objective of this paper is to understand how swift has become the monopoly in terms of the digital payment transaction industry.
2019-0035,1,the methodology adapted in this paper is qualitative secondary research case study method.
2019-0035,2,the study undertook a literature review analysis where the literature of more than fifty research papers and reports were analyzed and themes were generated.
2019-0035,3,hence twelve such themes evolved and then thematic content analysis was executed through grounded theory method.
2019-0035,4,the reliability of the data source mentioned were taken from relevant organizations involved in cross border payments and validation of the reports were done by experts in this field of financial ecosystem.
2019-0035,5,swift still enjoys monopoly in the market in terms of its huge network and the number of banks it partners across 200 + countries in the world.
2019-0035,6,but the new block chain technology launched by ripple and bitcoin and other small start-ups has posed a challenge to the existing traditional cross border payment system of swift.
2019-0035,7,block chain has a peer-to-peer communication with no intermediary network required.
2019-0035,8,it involves a simple transaction charge with the flexibility to share documents over network for better transparency.
2019-0035,9,but swift having a legacy incredibility and trust can ensure more reliable services to the businesses in cross border payments.
2019-0011,0,this paper examines the feasibility of fintech as a platform for sustainable economic growth and as a prompter of the fourth industrial revolution.
2019-0011,1,"to analyze the role of fintech in the national economy, we first broaden its definition and compare its economic performance using three methodologies-demand-driven model, supply-driven model and industry linkage effect in interindustry analysis."
2019-0011,2,we find that the fintech industry has a stronger effect on production inducement.
2019-0011,3,"regarding industry linkage effects, fintech ranked the top in all 31 industries for the forward linkage effect and 22 for the background linkage effect-much higher than the traditional financial industry."
2019-0011,4,this implies that the fintech industry is effective as the intermediate good with national demand as well as the final good.
2019-0011,5,"particularly, this industry plays the roles of intermediate and final goods across almost all industries."
2019-0011,6,"that is, fintech could better promote overall national economic performance as a platform industry."
2019-0011,7,"because most businesses within the fintech industry depend on innovation through the integration of finance and information technology, we find that fintech can feasibly prompt the fourth industrial revolution."
2019-0011,8,"nonetheless, this industry is characterized by excessive regulations in korea, indicating the need for negative regulation for new, innovative businesses within the fintech industry that would critically emphasize innovativeness for inclusive, sustainable economic growth."
2019-0010,0,this article interrogates recent policy pronouncements around the promotion of emerging financial technologies (fintech) as means of enabling financial inclusion.
2019-0010,1,it is argued that situating this emergent turn to technology in the context of a longer-running pattern of failed efforts to promote the development of financial markets for the poor in the global south offers us a useful lens on the dynamics of neoliberalism.
2019-0010,2,"the article develops this analysis by drawing together interlinked discussions of neoliberal reason, highlighting the central role played by the diffusion of market institutions in neoliberal projects with marxian discussions highlighting the crucial underlying role of labour in enabling the operation of markets."
2019-0010,3,"in this context the appeal to ever-more fine-grained information with which to allocate credit underlying the turn to technology can both be read as yet another attempt to re-engineer the market, and also seen as a doomed project."
2019-0010,4,"empirically, this argument is fleshed out through an engagement with key framework documents around financial inclusion and technology from the world bank and g20."
2019-0006,0,it is increasingly common to claim that innovative financial technologies (fintech) will enable ever-wider access to credit.
2019-0006,1,previous critical accounts have often linked the development of fintech to processes of financialization.
2019-0006,2,"however, these arguments rarely take account of the uneven and highly limited character of financial inclusion in practice."
2019-0006,3,"drawing on engagements with science and technology studies and historical materialist political economy, this article advances an approach emphasizing processes of abstraction from productive activities, mediated through particular infrastructures, as core elements of financial accumulation."
2019-0006,4,"seen in this light, psychometrics in particular and alternative credit data more broadly can be seen as flawed efforts to confront three sets of limits(1) the necessarily reductive character of abstract framings, and the consequent challenges posed by their encounter with complex processes in practice, (2) the ways that systems for credit scoring interact with the infrastructures of existing financial systems, and (3) the difficulty of realizing financial profits in the context of widespread precarious livelihoods."
2019-0006,5,"looking at alternative forms of credit data from this angle offers a way of grasping the truncated and uneven rollout of fintech, and hence of prompting more critical reflections about the limits to processes of financialization."

2018-0007,3,the study will surveyed the recent trends of mobile fintech payment services and categorized them based on the service forms to suggest requirements and security challenges so that better and securer service can be provided in the future.
2018-0007,4,"first, the study defined existing payment services and fintech payment services by comparing them, and analyzed recent mobile fintech payment services to classify mobile fintech payment service providers into hardware makers, operating system makers, payment platform providers, and financial institutions to show their common features."
2018-0007,5,"finally it defined requirements that mobile fintech payment services must meet and security challenges that future and present mobile fintech payment services will encounter in the perspective of mutual authentication, authorization, integrity, privacy, and availability."
2018-0007,6,"through the suggested study, it is expected that mobile fintech payment services will develop into more secure services in the future."
2018-0002,0,"based on a systematic review of influential publications among 402 papers published between 2010 and 2018, this paper identifies gaps in economics and finance research regarding two applications of fintech: crowdfunding and blockchain."
2018-0002,1,analysing these records shows that (i) current research on fintech is fragmented with limited theoretical grounding.
2018-0002,2,(ii) crowdfunding and blockchain can be regarded as two innovations that may disrupt traditional financial intermediation but in different ways.
2018-0002,3,"(iii) crowdfunding platforms substitute for traditional financial intermediaries and serve as a new intermediary, without eliminating the need for intermediation."
2018-0002,4,"(iv) similar to crowdfunding, blockchain also creates new intermediaries."
2018-0002,5,and (v) the trust element inherent in blockchain enables blockchain to eliminate the need for intermediaries in some financial areas but not all.
2018-0001,0,the purpose of this paper is to develop an insight and review the effect of fintech development against the broader environment in financial technology.
2018-0001,1,"we further aim to offer various perspectives in order to aid the understanding of the disruptive potential of fintech, and its implications for the wider financial ecosystem."
2018-0001,2,"by drawing upon very recent and highly topical research on this area this study examines the implications for financial institutions, and regulation especially when technology poses a challenge to the global banking and regulatory system."
2018-0001,3,"it is driven by a wide-ranging overview of the development, the current state, and possible future of fintech."
2018-0001,4,this paper attempts to connect practitioner-led and academic research.
2018-0001,5,"while it draws on academic research, the perspective it takes is also practice-oriented."
2018-0001,6,"it relies on the current academic literature as well as insights from industry sources, action research and other publicly available commentaries."
2018-0001,7,"it also draws on professional practitioners roundtable discussions, and think-tanks in which the author has been an active participant."
2018-0001,8,"we attempt to interpret banking, and regulatory issues from a behavioural perspective."
2018-0001,9,the last crisis exposed significant failures in regulation and supervision.
2018-0001,10,it has made the financial market law and compliance a key topic on the current agenda.
2018-0001,11,disruptive technological change also seems to be important in investigating regulatory compliance followed by change.
2018-0001,12,we contribute to the current literature review on financial and digital innovation by new entrants where this has also practical implications.
2018-0001,13,we also provide for an updated review of the current regulatory issues addressing the contextual root causes of disruption within the financial services domain.
2018-0001,14,the aim here is to assist market participants to improve effectiveness and collaboration.
2018-0001,15,the difficulties arising from extensive regulation may suggest a more liberal and principled approach to financial regulation.
2018-0001,16,"disruptive innovation has the potential for welfare outcomes for consumers, regulatory, and supervisory gains as well as reputational gains for the financial services industry."
2018-0001,17,it becomes even more important as the financial services industry evolves.
2018-0001,18,"for example, the preparedness of the regulators to instil culture change and harmonise technological advancements with regulation could likely achieve many desired outcomes."
2018-0001,19,"such results range from achieving an orderly market growth, further aiding systemic stability and restoring trust and confidence in the financial system."
2018-0001,20,our action-led research results have implications for both research and practice.
2018-0001,21,"these should be of interest to regulatory standard setters, investors, international organisations and other academics who are researching regulatory and competition issues, and their manifestation within the financial and social contexts."
2018-0001,22,"as a perspective on a social construct, this study appeals to regulators and law makers, entrepreneurs, and investors who participate in technology applied within the innovative financial services domain."
2018-0001,23,"it is also of interest to bankers who might consider fintech and strategic partnerships as a prospective, future strategic direction.1"
2018-0006,0,fintech has been playing an increasing role in shaping financial and banking landscapes.
2018-0006,1,"in this paper, we use account-level data from lendingclub and y-14m data reported by u.s. banks with assets over $50 billion to examine whether the fintech lending platform could expand credit access to consumers."
2018-0006,2,"we find that lendingclub's consumer lending activities have penetrated areas that may be underserved by traditional banks, such as in highly concentrated markets and areas that have fewer bank branches per capita."
2018-0006,3,we also find that the portion of lendingclub loans increases in areas where the local economy is not performing well.
2018-0024,0,"technological innovation, recent regulatory initiatives and mass consumers' changing expectations are quickly re-shaping the payments' sector, paving the way to a more open environment where even non-banking players see a huge opportunity to gain momentum and disrupt the incumbents, namely the financial institutions."
2018-0024,1,"fintech startups, high-tech firms but also mobile network operators are indeed challenging the status quo with their innovative propositions, trying to disintermediate banks from their traditional function of payment service providers."
2018-0024,2,"in the payments market, mobile wallets represent one of the innovations with highest potential of growth in the consumer-to-business segment."
2018-0024,3,payment market is a large and profitable segment for retail banking.
2018-0024,4,"besides revenue streams from card payment transactions, new sources of revenueas and value creation have been unleashed by digital payments."
2018-0024,5,"this paper contributes to provide a better understanding of the mobile wallet ecosystem, also analyzing a set of four business cases so to identify potential sources of competitive advantage for retail banks in a market characterized by an increased non-bank competition."
2018-0024,6,mobile wallet platforms can be a powerful tool for banks to cope with the customer-centric approach.
2018-0024,7,"the structure of the paper analyse the recent trends in the financial services industry, involving the entry of new players (fintech)."
2018-0024,8,the evolution of payments in the market.
2018-0024,9,the concept of ecosystem applied to the new payment landscape.
2018-0024,10,and it outlines the banks' roles in the new mobile payment environment.
2018-0025,0,"fintech, the merging of finance and modern internet-based technology, has rapidly presented itself as a disruptor to traditional business financing, notably in the form of crowdfunding and peer-to-peer (p2p) lending."
2018-0025,1,"in this paper, we examine the determinants of the use of fintech finance by businesses, with a particular focus on the ownership, governance, and business practices that may modify the relationships with conventional motivations for external finance."
2018-0025,2,"using a comprehensive sample of chinese hi-tech small and medium-sized enterprises (smes), we find that state-owned enterprises (soes) and family firms and financially constrained firms are respectively much less and much more likely to seek fintech finance."
2018-0025,3,"in the chinese context, we argue that part of this may be because of the relative ease with which soe smes can access cheaper conventional finance through soe banks."
2018-0025,4,the quality of traditional relationship banking also affects the relative desirability of fintech financing.
2018-0025,5,"as for family firms, we find that innovation, as exemplified by rd activity, effectively overrides any conventional reluctance to access external finance, suggesting the relative benefits of fintech finance for innovative high-growth firms."
2018-0026,0,the purpose of the study was too disruptive technology.
2018-0026,1,the rapid changes in technology due to the innovation has brought an impacts in changes on human lifestyle.
2018-0026,2,technology simplifies and accelerates human being in doing its activity.
2018-0026,3,the development of digital technology (disruptive technology) has an impact on all aspects of human life.
2018-0026,4,the purpose of this research is to see the phenomenon of the conventional banking in indonesia to make changes in its business processes in order to compete with fintechs company that is growing rapidly.
2018-0026,5,this research method looks at the phenomenon on conventional banking in indonesia by looking at the impact of technology and digital.
2018-0026,6,"the first phenomenon is the rapid development in the world currently occur in the digital economy, one of which is a digital-based financial service known as financial technology (fintech)."
2018-0026,7,"the second phenomenon is digital technology has been able to change the behavior of indonesian people in all aspects of life, such as electronic books, electronic newspapers, online sales and public transportation (taxis and motorcycles)."
2018-0026,8,"the third phenomenon is fintechs services in indonesia include payment channel system, digital banking, online/digital insurance, peer-to-peer (p2p) lending and crow funding."
2018-0026,9,banks should be able to balance the development of this digital technology by providing new products that are close to customer's wishes.
2018-0026,10,there is a gap that has not been served by banks in indonesia that resulted in the emergence of potential benefits that can be taken by start-up company (pioneer) fintech in providing services and banking products.
2018-0026,11,banking in indonesia can synergize with start-up companies (pioneer) fintech by changing its business process by doing business process reengineering (bpr).
2018-0008,0,"complementing europe's bank-based system with deeper capital markets and more cross-border financial integration promises benefits, but despite long-running debate and policy action, financial system change remains slow."
2018-0008,1,fintech has the potential to change financial intermediation structures substantially.
2018-0008,2,"it could disrupt existing intermediation with new business models empowered by intelligent algorithms, big data, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence."
2018-0008,3,lower costs and potentially better consumer experiences could be the driving forces.
2018-0008,4,"yet, empirically, fintech remains very small, especially in the european union (eu)."
2018-0008,5,"even the largest fintech market, in china, is of marginal size compared to overall financial intermediation."
2018-0008,6,"in the eu, much of fintech is concentrated in the uk."
2018-0008,7,we argue that policymakers need to consider four questions urgently.
2018-0008,8,(i) develop a european or national fintech market?
2018-0008,9,(ii) what regulatory framework to pursue?
2018-0008,10,(iii) should supervision of fintech be exercised at the european level?
2018-0008,11,(iv) what is the overall vision for the eu's financial system?
2018-0008,12,getting the answers to these questions right at an early stage of market development constitutes an opportunity to shape a stable and cost-efficient financial system.
2018-0008,13,"in contrast, late action could mean that europe loses out to foreign competitors and misses an opportunity to improve financial intermediation in europe."
2018-0028,0,"fintech, which is a shorthand expression for financial technology, is basically referring to all the technological innovations in the financial sector that started to develop exponentially, especially in the second decade of the 21st century, in the era of the mobile internet revolution."
2018-0028,1,"the generation z, also called gen tech, who was growing up using the internet and especially the mobile internet on a daily basis, will probably be the larger adopter and beneficiary of these innovative financial technologies."
2018-0028,2,"the current generation of students, born about twenty years ago, is part of this cohort and this is why we decided to initiate a study regarding their perception and behavior concerning the fintech area with the help of a questionnaire applied on some of the students of the faculty of european studies from babes-bolyai university."
2018-0028,3,"because the fintech is covering financial innovations from a very broad area (including cryptocurrency, online payments, financial transfers, openbanking, investments, regtech, insurtech, etc.)"
2018-0028,4,"we decided to focus in this preliminary study, only on the blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies and in relation to these, on the online payments."
2018-0003,0,the financial sector is facing radical transformation.
2018-0003,1,"leveraging digital technologies to offer innovative services, fintech start-ups are emerging in domains such as asset management, lending, or insurance."
2018-0003,2,"despite increasing investments, the fintech phenomenon is low on theoretical insights."
2018-0003,3,"so far, the offerings of fintech start-ups have been predominantly investigated from a functional perspective."
2018-0003,4,"as a functional perspective does not suffice to fully understand the offerings of fintech start-ups, we propose a taxonomy of non-functional characteristics."
2018-0003,5,"thereby, we restrict our analysis to consumer-oriented fintech start-ups."
2018-0003,6,"our taxonomy includes 15 dimensions structured along the perspectives interaction, data, and monetization."
2018-0003,7,we demonstrate the applicability of our taxonomy by classifying the offerings of 227 fintech start-ups and by identifying archetypes via a cluster analysis.
2018-0003,8,"our taxonomy contributes to the descriptive knowledge on fintech start-ups, enabling researchers and practitioners to analyze the service offerings of fintech start-up in a structured manner."
2018-0020,0,this study explores the influence of trust and risk in the use of fintech in indonesian society.
2018-0020,1,this exploration is based on findings from previous studies that suggest that trust and risk are important aspects in considering the use of fintech.
2018-0020,2,the focus of this research is to develop and validate the research instruments that will be used next.
2018-0020,3,the basic theory of model development uses the theory of technology acceptance model (tam) developed by davis.
2018-0020,4,the models and instruments developed will be through pilot studies involving 133 communities as respondents.
2018-0020,5,this study is quantitative research and data obtained were analyzed using smart pls v3.0.
2018-0020,6,this analysis is conducted to ensure the level of reliability and validity of the instrument.

2018-0010,0,"in recent years, the new technological keywords, fintech and iot (internet of things) have attracted interest, and at the same time, as they have already become buzz words, a gap has appeared between technologies and services that will penetrate the market and those which will disappear."
2018-0010,1,recent years have seen a remarkable trend for companies in all business sectors and industries to try to improve and extend the lifetime of their existing businesses and services by introducing the newest technologies.
2018-0010,2,"there is a requirement for fintech or iot to be integrated into the society in order to move beyond this goal, and to create new business models or services that are not descended from their existing business fields or services itself."
2018-0010,3,"while some simply maintain existing business areas that lack potential for company development, several companies find it difficult to develop business through advanced concepts, because they are bound by their existing capabilities."
2018-0010,4,"thus, there is a need to find ways to create the business models and services that surpass vested interests, are sustainable, and which fulfil the demands of the society."
2018-0010,5,"products and services using technology have been in demand through the years, and occasionally, they can actually threaten the survival of existing businesses."
2018-0010,6,this clearly demonstrates that such products and services are truly indispensable for social creation.
2018-0010,7,"this paper aims to discuss the conceptualization of approaches necessary to create such products and services, and to provide ideas for new services by introducing examples."
2018-0032,0,"the second sentence in the fourth paragraph should read: we received more than 60 submissions in total, of which 75 percent dealt with issues that were well-connected to the phenomena and research innovations that we hoped to bring to jmis readers attention."
2018-0032,1,the publisher apologizes for this error.
2018-0004,0,the emergence of financial technology around the globe is driven by efforts to deconstruct and reimagine business models embedded within financial services.
2018-0004,1,entrepreneurial endeavours to this end are diverse.
2018-0004,2,"indeed, the propensity toward complexity is considerable, bridging a range of financial services, markets, innovations, industry participants, infrastructures, and technologies."
2018-0004,3,this study aims to improve comprehension of the global fintech landscape.
2018-0004,4,it is based on the analysis of start-ups that participated in swift's innotribe competition.
2018-0004,5,"we used cluster analysis to group 402 fintech start-up firms, and then selected representative cases to create a foundational understanding of the structure of the fintech landscape."
2018-0004,6,"the main findings of this work are: (1) the development of fintech clusters to classify core services, business infrastructures, and underlying component technologies, which characterize fintech."
2018-0004,7,"(2) an analysis of how fintechs synthesize different technologies to restructure flows of financial information through competitive and cooperative mechanisms of disinter-mediation, extension of access, financialization, hybridization, and personalization."
2018-0004,8,(3) an analysis of related strategies for value creation connected with the competitive and cooperative mechanisms that were identified.

2018-0012,0,financial technology or commonly known as fintech is relatively a new thing in indonesia.
2018-0012,1,this article is attempting to capture the dynamics of such technology in indonesia.
2018-0012,2,this paper was aimed to help researchers and academics who are interested in studying the phenomenon of fintech more broadly.
2018-0012,3,this study is descriptive and exploratory by nature.
2018-0012,4,"data were gathered from secondary sources, as well as interviews with practitioners, policy makers, and users."
2018-0012,5,"data were collected during the period from 2016 to 2018, which was divided into several different stages."
2018-0012,6,"the results of the study show that fintech is more than just a phenomenon, it cannot be compared to other start-ups, and has the potential to fundamentally change the business and economic landscape."
2018-0030,0,fintech startups and services are one of the most dynamic segments of the modern economy.
2018-0030,1,new financial technologies have already attracted many investors and form millions of budgets.
2018-0030,2,"changing the traditional financial services concept, fintech companies formed a new niche within the financial services market, the dynamic development of which determines the relevance of the development and implementation of an effective regulatory and oversight system."
2018-0030,3,the purpose of the article is to develop an economic and mathematical model for forecasting the development of the fintech market on the example of ukraine.
2018-0030,4,"in order to study the development of the fintech industry, a multiple regression model was presented."
2018-0030,5,"the model describes the dependence of the total investment value of fintech from venture investments in financial technology, venture investments in other technologies and venture investments in online lending."
2018-0030,6,"based on this model, the effect of attracting investments with new fintech projects on the total volume of investments in the industry was clarified."
2018-0030,7,"according to the model, with a change in investments in fintech by 1%, the total rate of venture investments decreases by 0.03, funds in new projects of other companies grow by 0.05, and venture investments in online lending increase by 0.89. according to the analysis of regulatory legislation in the foreign countries of the fintech services sphere, it was found that the regulation of most of the risks associated with the development of fintech services falls within the competence of different supervisory authorities, requiring cross-sectoral cooperation between public institutions."
2018-0021,0,"despite the increasing role of cross-border payments within the globalization processes and rapid growth of venture sector, an issue of its implementation remains to be a debatable point for many countries."
2018-0021,1,the paper identifies disruptive challenges for financial institutions need to adapt.
2018-0021,2,the research investigates the value and the investment flows structure as most obvious indicators of fintech and describes types of payments relationships there.
2018-0021,3,"the paper considers relationships between enterprises, financial institutions and individuals, which are formed in digital payments."
2018-0021,4,"to understand the difference between regular cross-border money transfers and p2p crossborder money transfers with transferwise, both mechanisms were researched and the benefits underlined."
2018-0021,5,"for ukraine, the improvement of existing cross-border payments system with fintech is a crucial challenge."
2018-0021,6,"that is why it is important to focus on providing knowledge for people, supporting start-ups in the sector and learning the best implementation practices."
2018-0021,7,a great example of cross-border payments of fintech in ukraine is transferwise.
2018-0021,8,"the difference between regular cross-border money transfers and peer-to-peer (p2p) money transfers appears in its benefits, such as lower and more expectable transfer fee, mid-market exchange rate, less transaction period."
2018-0021,9,"by transforming existing cost structures and mitigating market imperfections, they provide innovative services that meet the users' needs for speed, trust, low cost, usability, security and transparency."
2018-0021,10,the results show high potential of fintech for cross-border payment processing.
2018-0031,0,"in this paper, we present experiences from eight years of developing a financial transaction engine, using what can be described as an integration-test-centric software development process."
2018-0031,1,we discuss the product and the relation between three different categories of its software and how the relative weight of these artifacts has varied over the years.
2018-0031,2,"in addition to the presentation, some challenges and future research directions are discussed."
2018-0023,0,this paper proposes the random neural network with a new learning algorithm based on the genome model.
2018-0023,1,"following genetics, where information is transmitted in the combination of genes rather than the genes themselves, the proposed genetic model transmits information to future generations in the network weights rather than the neurons."
2018-0023,2,"the innovative genetic algorithm is implanted in a complex deep learning structure that emulates the human brain: reinforcement learning takes fast local current decisions, deep learning clusters provide identity and memory, deep learning management clusters take final strategic decisions and finally genetic learning transmits the information learned to future generations."
2018-0023,3,the presented algorithm and deep learning structure has been applied and validated in a fintech model.
2018-0023,4,"a smart investment application where an intelligent bankers are specialised in buy and sell decisions on several assets, markets and risks."
2018-0023,5,the obtained results are promising.
2018-0023,6,the proposed model combines human brain and genetics with deep learning structure based on the random neural network model where biology.
2018-0023,7,similar as artificial intelligence is learning gradually and continuously while adapting to the environment.
2018-0017,0,"background: since the global financial crisis, banks have been exposed to new opportunities and threats unprecedented in history driven fundamentally by technology."
2018-0017,1,"so-called fintech disruptors are aggressively tapping into their service delivery chain to offer clients a better (cheaper, more convenient or efficient) value proposition."
2018-0017,2,"as banks have subsequently been forced to think more strategically about how to conduct themselves due to the imminent use of, for example, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, biometrics and big data, regulators have simultaneously had to ensure that the pervasiveness of technological disruption does not threaten the soundness of banks and the stability of economies."
2018-0017,3,aim: to identify the strategic implications of fintech on south african retail banks.
2018-0017,4,setting: the study is conducted in the south african retail banking industry.
2018-0017,5,methods: a post-positivist paradigm approach that is qualitative in nature.
2018-0017,6,"results: there are several main findings: firstly, technology-based skills are becoming mandatory for staff and regulators alike."

2018-0033,6,"unlike for the harmonisation of eu rules on credit to consumers for the creation of the internal market, the underlying consumer data infrastructure remains fragmented at national level, failing to achieve univocal, common, or defined policy objectives under a harmonised legal framework."

2017-0004,5,"while this might limit the disruptive impact of payment innovations, it is argued that, in the light of the public policy needs for a stable and efficient public infrastructure and the social needs of confidence and trust in a predictable and regulated payment system that meets commercial and social expectations such as in consumer protection, this is not necessarily undesirable."
